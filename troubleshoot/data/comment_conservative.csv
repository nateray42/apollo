193,i9xy9n6,DreadPirateGriswold,"Well, I'm going to try and present another way to handle this situation... 

Conflicts of interest are bad.  And any corruption or crony quid pro quis should be slapped down as hard as possible.  Paging Nancy Pelosi.  But... 

The proposed solution of ""cannot trade securities ever"" is wrong, overly simplified, and quite frankly IMO an ""I hate the rich and the political class"" populist rallying cry. 

There are approx 6,500 public companies on the NYSE + NASDAQ alone.  Do you think bills they vote on affect all companies the same and they should not be owed to trade or own any of those 6,500 companies ever, even after their terms are up? 

I'm not assuming all politicians are corrupt from day one.  I'm assuming corruption should be dealt with severely when it is known to have happened. 

This problem HAS been solved for decades in private sector financial companies with the use of Compliance Depts to monitor your holdings and transactions and pre-clearance of trades. 

If you don't know what those are, look them up.  I won't detail that here.  But it has to be applied to all politicians at all levels. 

These concepts have been around at least to my knowledge since I started working professionally out of college in the early 1990s for financial firms. 

Imaging you just won an election to become a newly-minted US House freshman rep.  You have a portfolio of stocks and bonds that's been in your family for decades, like a 401K where you have stocks in it and you have trading authority.

Now what?  Since you were elected by the public to serve as their rep, what do you do with your existing portfolio(s) since putting it in a blind trust (contents and transaction activities unknown to you) with someone else in charge of it who is NOT YOU for your term seems to be not acceptable now?

That portfolio generates money to send your kids to college or help your aging parents with extra money to live.  Like I said... It's more complicated than, ""You're not allowed to trade any stock ever.""

There would be no strict term limits, and if someone is really beloved by their constituents, they'd continue to get in. The downside would be this is both complicated and makes seats quite prone to flipping.

Why are companies even able to ""buy up all the housing"" when they can't buy up other essential goods, like ""all the food"" or ""all the clothing"". Because if they tried someone would just make more of those things and outcompete them. It's very hard to have a monopoly on all the resources to do so. So what's the limiting factor on just building more homes to meet the demand? Two things:

1) Permission to build. There's a default presumption in almost every city in the world that you shouldn't be allowed to build because of planning and zoning rules until you get permission, which is so hard to come by that when some parcels of land get rezoned they become several times more valuable. It needs to be the opposite. There should be a default presumption that you can build unless there's a really compelling reason not to.

2) Land. The supply of land is fixed, which means you can buy up ""all the land"" in an area and you can't incentivise anyone to make more. You could ban buying it up,  but a more elegant solution would be to tax land at 100% of the profit from the land *and only the land*. That way, people profit from producing useful things like buildings, not from hoarding natural resources. You could redistribute the revenue as a dividend to every citizen, or tax productive activities less, or whatever.

664,i9w7i93,badatusernames91,"Except there are guns that have exactly the same capabilities as ""assault weapons"" that don't fall under the category because of their appearance. Looking at the AR15, since it's the most popular gun to attack, there is nothing special about it that singles it out from other similar guns. The ammo anything special. It's why you really don't hunt any big game with them. Because in all likelihood, you're going to torture the poor thing and that's not ideal. Plenty of handguns would do far more damage. Also, no, ""you know what is"" is not a definition because all that does is open up gun grabbers to keep trying to change the definition. You need to explain exactly what it is you're talking about.

But great, you have something you want to solve. But here's the problem with the data. 

School shootings are a very broad classification. Here are some things that count as school shootings:

-An individual committing suicide in a parking lot on school property in the dead of night with no one around.

-shootings that happen in the vicinity of a school

-the gun of an SRO going off accidentally, even if it doesn't hit anyone

-shootings that happen on the property of a school system, even if it is long abandoned.

-shootings in the vicinity of a school function (so if a school rents out a hotel ballroom for prom and shooting happens by the hotel, that counts as a school shooting)

These numbers from your link are not a tally of every incident where an individual walked into the school and started shooting. And that becomes pretty clear quickly when you line up the deaths with the incidents.

I don't buy that the solution is gun grabbing. We've done that before and it didn't work. We've been promised multiple times thar the latest bill will be the bill to solve everything and it never is. And if we're going to look at school shootings where an individual goes in and shoots students, you know what's missing in the lives of many of them? A father. Not every single time, but pretty damn often. The welfare state and sexual revolution have been a complete disaster for families. All the power to single mothers who kick ass, but the vast majority of the time, kids need a father in the home when possible (an abusive father doesn't belong  in the home, but that's not the issue the vast majority of the time).",t1_i9w4l6q,0,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ux33k8

Anyway, the point about ""everyone knows what assault weapons are"" is because we don't need to get caught up in the technicalities. We can let experts and legislators figure that out. But I also would like to push back on the idea that you need to be extremely specific and precise in your legal language. A significant portion of the legal system is designed to operate in gray areas. We don't have a 1000 point checklist that defines \*exactly\* what is and isn't self defense. We have some general guidelines, and then leave it up to the judges, prosecutors, juries, etc that look at the facts in a particular case, consider the intent of the law, and make a decision. If you're too specific, then I'd argue that it becomes easier to find loopholes, because the judgements are going to be more dependent on technicalities. But either way, that's up for the legislators to figure out. We're not here to write the actual bills, after all.

If you sign a contract to suck their dick technically you have a choice not to. The same goes for signing a contract to work under the diress of starvation in our society.

The fact is that almost all of these shooters are young men who felt socially isolated, unloved, and promptly radicalized. Some of the aberrations, like the Las Vegas shooter, was not young but he suffered the same symptoms. I don’t know what the solution is here, but I do think that annual check-ins with a therapist and/or psychiatrist should be the standard and covered by all insurance plans, as well as ongoing therapy.

As far as the guns go, yes, they are a problem. There are depressed and rage-filled people all over the world, but only in America do they have the weapon access to commit this regularly. I think there are a few very simple solutions: Raise the minimum buying age to 21, require a verified in-person reference to vouch for buyer’s well-being at point of sale, and yes, I do think we need to ban the sale of automatic weapons.

385,ia436qz,disgruntled_pie,"I know you’re being sarcastic, but I want to respond to one point seriously.

Police claim that once the shooter got into the classroom he locked the door behind himself, and police were unable to break through the door. If this is true (details are still fuzzy, this could turn out to be false) then it would mean that turning schools into fortresses is not a good answer. Once the fox gets into the reinforced hen house there’s no way to get them out!

Ted Cruz has been blaming the shooting on the school having more than one door. Okay, let’s build schools with only one door. But what happens when there’s a fire? A lot more kids are going to die.

As I see it, we have two options:

1.	Do something about guns. Republicans hate this.
2.	Do something about mental health. We’re going to need to provide mental healthcare for everyone free of charge (“socialized medicine”). It’s not enough to provide healthcare to people who can afford it. I don’t want my kid getting murdered by someone simply because they couldn’t afford mental healthcare.

If you’re not willing to do either of those things then you are contributing to the next school shooting like this. There are no other options that could possibly work. Either it’s a gun problem like the liberals say, or it’s a mental health problem like the conservatives say.

Make it a felony to leave weapons unsecured where minor can access them.

Mandatory and free education on safe and proper operation and storage of firearms for first time buyers.

If you want to arm teachers then make sure you compensate them appropriately. Raise their pay for doing police work in addition to teaching.

Put fences and gates around school grounds with single entry and exit points manned by guards, though this might be difficult for schools with multiple buildings spaced far apart.

Add mental health screenings by professionals to background checks with mandatory minimum wait times of at least 48  hours when purchasing firearms.

I know 2A advocates hate infringements but I'll still put it out there. 

How about adding a referral process? A free physician evaluation and/or a family/friend referral process. The idea is that if they can vouch for you in terms of discounting any suspicious or violent behavior then it severely lessens the wait time. 

If you think you know of someone you trust to vouch for you and they understand the seriousness of their support they won't hesitate to decline when you ask them in the case of violent or suspicious behavior. 

This is not to say that people have to go through this referral process but their background check/psych evaluation could be more stringent if they have no one at all to vouch for them. They can still get a firearm but it might take longer maybe?

Again please don't crucify me, I'm just putting it out there. I know many people hate this line of thinking, but isn't it better than removing guns completely? This type of system might help for those shootings involving legally purchased firearms.",t1_ia2tar9,8,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,uy57xv

I know a ton of people who have been popped by cops with a bag of weed before it was legalized in my state.

I've never met a soul in the free world or in prison who's said they had a federal weed possession conviction. And if they did if was like charge number 14 of probably a much bigger more significant case.

This is a cool step though. Maybe it will give alot of governors political cover to do this on the state level. That would potentially help 10s of millions of people.

But you are missing a point.  Under our laws an accused is innocent unless or until proven guilty by a court, by competent evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt.  So it is true that most convictions come from plea deals.  But it is not, necessarily true that all or that some significant portion of possession convictions are folks guilty of something more serious...in fact, the opposite is true.   If the state offers a plea deal and the person takes that deal, they are guilty of that offense (the one they pled to).  They are NOT guilty of any offense that was dropped as part of the plea deal

  
It is also good to understand how prosecution works.  As a former prosecutor I would charge EVERY POSSIBLE crime...you do this because it is difficult if not impossible to change pleadings after you bring the accused to trial.  So the fact someone was charged with possession and distribution but plead to possession (and the distribution was dropped) tells me that there was not sufficient evidence to reach conviction, beyond a reasonable doubt, on distribution.",t1_irbtg3o,2,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,xxe5wl

It isn’t an accident, it’s a system that’s been manipulated and defiled over many decades to keep power centralized in the hands of a small in-group who believe themselves to be our masters. Outsiders who somehow find themselves inside that in-group are made (or sometimes are more than happy to) tow the line, whether through bribes or threats- specifically threats against their power/influence- or some combination of both. 

Sometimes you get outsiders hell-bent on bucking the system like AOC or Sanders who manage to maintain influence anyway but their influence is minor because they don’t have the backing of the party power structure.

We don’t have a true social democrat platform in America, because that runs contrary to the established power structure that the people with the money want to keep in place. We also thank the gods, don’t (yet) have a true fascist platform because that would be the redline that divides the nation irrevocably.

So we get to choose between the corporatists that want to appeal to the side of America that loves Jesus and distrusts minorities or the corporatists that want to appeal to the side of America that values equality and bodily sovereignty above all else.

“But it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it America has failed to hear?...It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.""

36,ht3ke3o,Bigmans9,"To all the non-conservative lurkers and people who post on subreddit drama and shit, let me explain the conservative stance on national heroes, of which Martin Luther King, Jr. most certainly is.

We celebrate people for their greatness, because they represent something great in history. No human is perfect. We celebrate MLK for his colorblind civil rights leadership paving the way for equality for Black Americans. That is what he stands for and what makes him a hero. We do not celebrate his socialist views. We do not celebrate him being a misogynist. He is an American hero despite these things, because of the good he did and the good he represents.

We feel the same way about Lincoln. He is an American hero because he brought an end to slavery. Not because of a few racist letters he wrote. He is an American hero for the good he did and the good he represents, not the bad.

We feel the same way about many founding fathers. They are heroes because they brought life to a free, wonderful country founded on the notion that all men are created equal, not because many of them failed to live up to those same values in their own lives.

The point is that no one is perfect, human beings all have some form of evil in their hearts. We do not celebrate them that part that makes them just like everyone else. We celebrate them for the part of them that puts them above others in history. MLK is not remembered for his opinions on economics or his private radicalism. Rather, he's remembered for his public stance of colorblind equality i.e. true equality. Y'all don't get to claim that conservatives don't get to celebrate a great American hero because we don't believe in socialism or pro-riots any such nonsense.

While I agree with what you said, the current BLM movement is less equality, and more equity, meaning they want black people to have special privilege to “amount to white privilege” in a sense. Also, correct me if I’m wrong, MLK was more of a “stand up to the big man” (peaceful protest) revolutionary, and BLM today is more “fight for our side” (not specifically peaceful all the time). 

It’s hard to interpret a quote without hearing the true context, and having a detailed background knowledge of that time period and who MLK was, but I don’t necessarily see it as violent as it sounds, and more motivational and inspirational to the people listening, promising them that change will come because of their efforts. 

All in all, it’s the supporters (of both MLK and BLM) that shape the foundation of their protest, which can shed a positive or negative light on them.

Feel free to read the law. It just relates to transmitting/keeping certain documents, not espionage.

Sections a-c clearly don't apply because they require ""reason to believe the information **is to be used** to the injury of the US, or to the advantage of any foreign nation"".

Sections d and e may apply, but I doubt it, as they require the person to either ""transmit to someone not 'entitled' to the sensitive information"" or to ""willfully retain it and not return it (on demand) to **the** officer/employee 'entitled' to receive it"".

So, at best, maybe you can charge him if they had asked him to return the documents, he refused, and they can successfully argue that they were 'the officer/employee ""entitled"" ' to receive them.

The biggest problem with this is actually arguing that they were 'entitled' to the documents, which to me seems sketchy as hell. Who is ""**the** officer/employee"" entitled to a document? As the former president, when he was president, there is nobody more entitled to a document more than him.

Keep in mind, I don't really know what I'm talking about, but just reading the law and being a rational human being, I really doubt a sane court could charge him on this.

Also, if Trump really feels he declassified these documents, and that he was in the moral right to do so, then he should post them all to his website immediately. He needs the argument to be about whether the documents were declassified or not. And it needs to play out in public.

The successful entrepreneurs and financiers who can smell BS a mile away and will throw their support behind less radical political leaders. The parents with morals who refuse to tolerate a public education system trying to chemically castrate their children, and will vote out leftist school boards and takeover local education. The LEOs who’ve given decades to enforcing the law and will not stand by while it’s usurped. The devoutly religious and their leaders who will preach freedom at every opportunity.

They go to work and the woke companies they work for parrot the leftist talking points.

They go home and watch TV or movie made by an industry who has made it their job to regurgitate leftist ideals.

From there, they turn on TV and watch shows created by liberals that lean to the left, if they have any political viewpoint at all.

But for me (and I'm sure others) opposition to abortion isn't a political thing. It's a moral stance. If someone believes that a greater welfare system, greater access to childcare services or greater emphasis on access to condoms and other forms of (non-abortive) birth control will severely curb abortions, then that's better then the alternative.

Of course. Its a progressive solution to a progressive-caused problem, that being single motherhood. 

This is another example of a progressive thinking they have invented the wheel. We already have a conservative solution to this problem of ""unsupported fetuses (aka children)"" its called marriage.  And yes, there have always been tragedies outside that paradigm the world has to deal with, we usually used to call them ""widows"" or something quite pejorative. And in the cases of the pejorative, we rarely gave them subsidies at all, because doing so only encourages bad behavior going forward. 

In the ""bad old days"" we were allowed to recognize reality: Sperm is cheap, eggs and wombs are not. So it was the responsibility of the woman and her family to preserve the value of a scare resource. Philandering men is not  a new phenomena. It is a long-living known thing that we've consistently had to develop ways to defend society against it, because it is antisocial. Child support is one of the least effective tools we have ever developed as a defense against it because it has little effect against the worst offenders: Low-intelligence, out of work men.",t1_htu73po,-12,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,sa5wzj

Whether you think this is conservative or not, i suppose depends on whether you accept the biological reality that sperm is cheap. It is healthy for individual men to want to impregnate every fertile woman they see. It is unhealthy for society to allow that to happen because it results in a lot of bastards and a lot of incels (aka lost boys, aka men who have no spouse or children, aka a hugely disruptive revolutionary force). 

Progressivism broke down those barriers and said, ""Its okay to fuck every woman you see, so long as you pay child support."" But that didn't really do any good. The men who would have married women in the old system already were, and the baddies that no one would let their daughter marry just started knocking up women left and right. And then they couldn't pay child support anyways in any meaningful way.

*Edit also: In our new system the lost boys are supposed to settle for marrying the single mother of another man's child whos slept with dozens of men. Otherwise they are called ungrateful incels. 

** Also No fault divorce is a negative contributing factor to these problems.

*** Also all these systems seem to be inferior for the children to the traditional wedding and death do us part, and even inferior to the ""shotgun wedding"", particularly with regards to the lower classes. Only the highest income people have successfully weathered the no fault divorce and single motherhood waves.

As Veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who was trained and volunteered. My respect goes out to the civilians of Ukraine who were just working normal Jobs and now stand a post with a rifle in the cold. Sun is up now there, but many cold and long nights await.

People think it is about combat and fighting.

It is the waiting and moving. It is struggling through daily movements with lack of sleep. It is the fear of the unknown.

It will not be some video game. You might get a moment of combat with hours of boredom and lack of sleep. You will feel abandoned and scared.

The war will go on. Your ability to withstand it is on your shoulders and it hurts.

It is your homeland, which as a Marine I have never defended. You will.

Russia should be able to crush them but support is rolling in now. Fortunately, Putin has to take Kiev and other important cities in order to install a puppet government which means boots on the ground and urban warfare - this gives time for allies financial support and sanctions to have an impact.

This being said.........yeah, sanctions+weapons won't help too much if it's just Ukrainian boots - NATO should step up, in particular Germany, the UK...looking very weak right now. The Eastern bloc relies on these countries economically and politically and they're leaving them out to dry.

411,hyi968v,SmoothSecond,"I promise you, we probably agree on a lot. I would agree we are morally bound to hold to the treaties our elected leaders sign. We have no defensive treaties with Ukraine or Taiwan. That is simply the fact of the matter.

What obligations have we made to defend Ukraine or Taiwan in a military conflict? You used the word ""obligations"" so I assume you know what it means. This is why international treaties are crafted carefully and the signing ceremonies are a big deal. It is formal, in front of cameras, gifts are often exchanged. These formalities may seem frivolous but they actually mean alot. 

I assume you know all of this because you say that we are not legally bound to defend Ukraine. Then you brush all this carefully crafted diplomacy aside with ""we are morally bound"" to defend Ukraine. I'm inclined to feel the same way, and Taiwan as well. 

I wonder what your feelings toward Afghanistan are? If we were honor bound to morally defend anyone on earth you could make the case we were bound to the fledgling democracy we planted there. Yet we left. And as someone who fought in Afghan 2004-2005, I can tell you we made the right decision to leave. Not HOW we left, but the fact that we left.

Due to that experience, and growing a little older and wiser, I think more about the human cost of these decisions. It is easy to say we should charge around the world and defend people we feel affinity for. But are you going to be the one who gets killed in Donbass? Or the Taiwan strait? Will you send your child to die in the Ukrainian mud? 

And I disagree that fighting China will be harder or bloodier. A confrontation with China will mostly happen at sea where we have the advantage in experience and technology. On paper China has more ships but they are sorely lacking in actual naval prowness. A fight with Russia will be mostly on land and involve enormous armor formations that must grind eachother into dust. Don't forget China has much the same doctrine and military as Russia. 

A full scale war between nuclear powers over our feelings of obligation, not actual diplomatic obligations, is literally how the world might end. Do you think whoever is left will say, ""At least America upheld their moral obligations""...?",t1_hyhznuh,8,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,t1oa8u

And I completely agree on your assessment on the lack of legally binding treaties of mutual defense with either nation in question. However where it appears our disagreement is, is along the assurances made to the Ukrainians in exchange for their nuclear disarming. I feel that those assurances of supporting their sovereignty and territorial integrity should amount to more than sanctions. At the very least we should be arming Ukraine to the teeth and be seen doing it, not just funneling it through Poland or the Baltic nations as intermediaries. I guess what I'm getting at is basically this, we gave our word, and that should mean something, not only to the people and nations we gave it too, but more importantly to ourselves.

To address another of your points, I didn't serve in the military so I don't know the true consequences of the actions I call for, and I fully acknowledge that fact. I have lost friends and former classmates, one in Iraq and two others once they got home. But I know they didn't die for nothing, they died for the values America has stood for, and strives to attain each day. Intervening ourselves would create more suffering, hardship, and heartache for another American generation. That is another indisputable fact. But what are our self professed values really worth if we shirk the duty that comes with them when it will be difficult?

I think I've addressed the main crux of our discussion above but I feel like I owe you the respect of answering your other points as you gave me such a well thought out reply.

As to Afghanistan: Yes we should have left, I'm in total agreement we did it the wrong way. I'll go on a limb and say we probably share the sentiment that we left behind many people to suffer we owed a debt to. If the moral debt we owed to them didn't extend to securing their land for them, then at a minimum it should have gone far enough to help them leave if they chose too.

To be completely honest I feel like America has lost something, something that I can't really find the words to describe. Perhaps that feeling I have led me to this point.

I was watching that Netflix documentary on Boeing the other day, and there's a part where Trump grounds the 737-Max for safety reasons. It is presented as a good thing, the right thing to do...the people I was watching it were fuming. The mere sight of him and the sound of his voice just triggered frothing rage. A completely Pavlovian response, developed by years of careful conditioning.

Are these people idiots? Of course. But they make up half of the country.

47,hysriwa,TankerD18,"I liked Trump as president, but that being said we seriously need to do better than Trump in '24. The left pinched their noses and elected an absolute doofus because they hate Trump *that* bad. The election fraud shit is dead, it's not going anywhere and the vote surges Biden got are easy to explain due to unprecedented mail-in balloting and Trump's shitty reputation. The fact of the matter is that leftists hate Trump a lot more than rightists love him. 

The left's entire platform right now is being anti-Trump, many of their other ideas are far-left duds and they know it. Without Trump they have almost nothing to campaign on. If Trump runs in '24 the political discussion shifts from everything Biden will have fucked up to all the stupid shit Trump said from '17-21/'24. It will be effectively allowing the left to overlook their own massive blunder in electing Biden. Putting Trump up again in '24 is the only way we lose. 

I'm sorry to say it but Trump's a dud, he's a loser and if we think we're going to win the White House on a platform of ""The news is out to get me and the Democrats cheated!"" then get prepared to be even more pissed off when we lose again!

**Vote in the primaries when the time comes, and vote for anyone but Trump.** Let's show the left that we aren't playing games anymore and the independents that we've learned a thing or two since 2020.

Trump's always been an abrasive personality, and he may have been right, but we need someone who can make people understand why he's right, not someone who's gonna tell people it's my way or the highway and get fucked if you don't like it.

The water in the super soakers represent their credibility. Expending it is effective against foes, but the super soakers refill very slowly and take a lot of energy to refill. Usually our political war is about each side trying to win the water fight by strategically shooting defeatable targets and conserving enough water to fight the next battle. When Trump came around, the Left unleashed all it's water on him at once, thinking it was the Right's last gasp in the war. ""If we crush him now and successfully paint their entire party with his faults, they're done"", the Left thought.  

As it turns out, Trump was much better at absorbing water than they thought. He soaked up almost all their water. He was still defeated, but the Left is not ready for the next several battles because the Right has a lot of water built up in their super soakers now relative to the Left.  

Literally all the Right has to do is shove the saturated sponge (Trump) to the side and put a new giant sponge out front, and they can't lose. Preferably a fancy new model that has design improvements to protect the Right better, regardless of whether it can absorb quite as much water. Domination guaranteed. Will the Right do this? Or will they say ""oh look how good that sponge worked right up until it got saturated...let's shove it right back out there"". The Right would be IDIOTIC to do this of course. A child can see that sponge is saturated and useless in this water fight.

If it doesn't go towards republicans in the mid-terms, then I don't think Trump would run, since it would essentially be an uphill battle on everything again, and he'd be unable to do what he'd wanted.

He deserves a fair shot to have his second term, and 2020 wasn't fair, and I do think it was stolen from him.

Physically, though, he's not in great shape. He isn't in terrible shape, either, but fitness levels correlate with not only mortality, but numerous other cognitive and physical issues alike.

Frankly the type of language against him sounds like liberals pretending to be conservatives.

Also..

4 years of Trump with a desantis run immediately after gives us TWO really good candidates for a possible 12 years.

The American populace isn't in support of it. Even a certain base of conservatives are addicted to government of one form or another. You can get people to agree that government is too big. But getting them to agree on specifics is another subject all together. As in what areas need to be cut will not be agreed upon. Democrats will occasionally agree to cutting defense spending, but that cycles every decade (depending on whether or not they are in power).

When Paul Ryan came up with a plan to do entitlement reforms. Democrats ran ads of him pushing a Grandma off the cliff.

The best bet would be a Constitutional Amendment pushed by the states that imposes limits on spending. This would force them to make decisions. Until that happens, no politician will ever do anything to address this besides virtue signal to you. Ted Cruz did have a plan to really cut back on alphabet agencies and the like. I doubt he could have gotten congress to go along with it.

So this is the place where ""lesser evil"" comes in. Who is the one to less expand government. Democrats who like to impose a new entitlement every decade that will never go away? Or Republican who fail to repeal said entitlements? Or maybe it's a wash and both are equally bad (this isn't true). Your next political calculus is to evaluate your next priority. As in if size of government is going to suck no matter what you vote for, what other issues matter to you.

Not saying democrats will vote for Trump but a good chunk will probably just stay home like they usually do. 2024 will be way different after all the stuff Biden is doing lol",t1_hytniv9,4,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,t3g5ns

I mean, why not have 3 terms of republican presidents? Because after desantis I literally don’t see any other viable candidates to be honest. Too many have proven to be spineless and I won’t vote red no matter who if it’s a Romney or some other shit candidate.

12,hpoqxty,Sea2Chi,"If it makes you guys feel any better, the left thinks this is BS too. Even AOC is calling her out. 

When I worked as a small-town journalist, I had restrictions on how I could buy stocks. The idea that someone who has that level of insight and forwarning about the market has fewer restrictions than I did is absolutely insane. 

I've also read about other politicians who would take ""consultancy"" meetings with investors and while they couldn't say ""buy this stock"" or ""sell now"" they could ""consult"" the investor on a difficult decision they were weighing and which way they were leaning. The investors of course all happened to be big donors. 

Of course, they're never going to vote for more restrictions on themselves, in the same way, they're never going to vote to give themselves a massive pay cut. 

The only thing you can really do is vote for someone else, which they're well aware the vast majority of people will never do because they've made sure to demonize the other side to the point that voting against your party is completely unthinkable.",t3_rmuxkk,82,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,rmuxkk

This is a problem on both sides and needs to be address as such. I know it easy to use Pelosi's name and talk shit (because honestly fuck that bitch and I'm a lefty) but you need to also call out YOUR congress member and voice your concerns about this.

So far the only people I've seen publicly call anyone out is Warren and AOC, which you all hate, so maybe we should get some more voices in there. If there are others I would love to know.",t3_rmuxkk,6,Conservative,t5_2qh6p,rmuxkk
