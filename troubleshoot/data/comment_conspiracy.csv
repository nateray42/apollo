One month into it, he got scared during a call and almost drew his gun, but luckily things didn't get off the ground and he went home safe. He turned in his badge the next day.

I went through the academy in 2007, my class was the first class where the instructors were not allowed to swear at you because it was unprofessional and too stressful. A few years before they had banned physical contact between recruits and trainers because some of the training staff took it too far and were hitting people.

The end result is that the police academy is no longer a grueling experience that weeds out the weak. I worked with officers who openly said they didn't think they could shoot someone. I worked with people who had no idea how to fight and no inclination to learn how. These people were soft. Development of less lethal alternatives have made many cops too comfortable - I don't need to scrap, I can taser. There are cops on the road who are drawing an easy paycheck with no understanding of what they may be called to do.

My agency forcibly removed the term ""warrior"" from all training, and you could get in trouble for using the term. ""You're not warriors, you're guardians!"" They would say. Fuck that. Give me one warrior over ten guardians any day. That old poem/proverb/whatever from Heraclitus about 100 men and most don't belong? That shit is 100% applicable to policing. I wouldn't be bold enough to say I was the one, but at least I wasn't in the 90.

Find a cop you trust, or at least one you trust to answer this question, and ask them how many people they work with who are worth having when the shit hits. How many are warriors, and how many are cannon fodder.

Lets not be so haste to blame the meatbags working for the police. Entire system is setup so that the money doesnt flow to social services to make society better and people happier and content so that they arent depressed and have a tendency to go on massive shooting sprees.. 

In america the wellfare stste is the military or prison industrial complex, the entire system is funded and created to protect the interets of the capitalist ruling elite and keep the working class inline and not desruptive too much towards that goal.

Police state is the social wellfare state, it provides jobs, it provides education, medicare, leave, retirement... Imagine if doctors, teachers, public wellfare workers got the benifits, training, support and funding the police gets... There are more police in america than anywhere else in the world.

You cant blame people that have little opportunity to have a nice life, when the onky avaikablities that many can get is either join the army or the police force. Getting loaded with debt in an economy that has near zero labour support or rights, when min wage is below living wages, when economy keeps crashing and reccession looms, the only stability is to join one of those large and funded institutions...

There is a reason why they used to consider iq tests for police officers, cant have intellegent people doing that job, so police force attracts that highschool levek education, that emotional intellegence that tyoe of person that will power trip.

Its systemic. Change the country, and perhaos the police force will change. But at the moment usa is a police state, that needs crime to justify huge police force, and since there is a huge police forcebthere needs to be crime for them to be useful.",t3_uykogw,0,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,uykogw

The pilot began calling on the radio that he was running out of fuel, so Ops had him land the plane and park on a taxiway with lights off. It was just after sun down. We let it run for a while, but knew the people shelling the base could hit the plane sitting in the open. So we ran out on the flight line to safe the weapons systems and marshall the pilot into the nearest empty hardened aircraft shelter. I got chewed out by our chief for going outside when it was alarm red. I'm like, hello, we just ensured a 30 million dollar jet and pilot are safe, we knew the dangers of being out in the open, but still chose to do the right thing.

Edit: I get what you're saying about screw the jet, we can buy more. If there was active shelling at the time, I would've stayed in the shelter.

From the article:

""The DeShaney decision has been cited by many courts across the nation and reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Namely—on June 27, 2005, in Castle Rock v. Gonzales, the U.S. Supreme Court again ruled that the police did not have a constitutional duty to protect a person from harm.[8]  The decision overturned a federal appeals court ruling which permitted a lawsuit against the town of Castle Rock for the police’s failure to respond after Jessica Gonzales tried to get the police to arrest her estranged husband Simon Gonzales for kidnapping their three daughters (ages 7, 8, and 10) while they were playing outside, in violation of a court-issued protective order. [9]  After Simon called to tell Jessica where they were at (in Denver at an amusement park), for hours she pleaded for the police to arrest Simon. [10] But, the police failed to act before Simon showed up at the police department and started shooting inside, and with the bodies of the 3 children in the trunk of his car.[11]""",t1_ia5ujp4,3,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,uykogw

Lord Louis Mountbatten. Close relative and confidant of the Royal family. Huge influence on Prince Charles when he was growing up.

Mountbatten is said to have introduced the monsterous Jimmy Saville to Prince Charles. Paving the way for an hugely unlikely but ultimately very close relationship. Mountbatten's FBI file accuses him of paedophilia. It was claimed in some quarters that the Lord's 'poor morals' led to his murder at the hands of the IRA. His 'lifestyle' could have led to embarrassment to the Royals and the IRA were given the opportunity to assassinate him.

Prince Andrew of course is another close friend of child procurers and abusers. The queen it seems has a clear issue with the conduct of her sons and the poor company they keep.

Despite Lord Louis Mountbatten being disgraced by the released FBI documentation. Prince William and his wife Kate named their latest son Louis Arthur Charles. The first and last names honouring his paternal great-great-great-uncle Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, and his paternal grandfather Charles, Prince of Wales.

To wit: this massively upvoted post is meant to keep us from other things. It's void of any important revelation and full of controversy, which includes the controversy that the environments in the photos don't match.

The shot on the left is a composite. The two humans are not in that scene, and the scene is highly manipulated (windows and scenery, lighting, etc.). The right pic is authentic, unless the Queen's head is from another source, but very good Photoshopping if so. The staging is bizarre though.

When goes to sleep as everyone does, his consciousness apparently was transferred to an exact clone of his body in a secret facility. (Only by sleeping was the transfer able to happen because your brain wave frequency changes during sleep). In this facility he was raped and tortured by elites who were also in clone versions of themselves. By his account queen Elizabeth was the one running things there as far as he could tell.  Because everyone is a clone if you die there you won’t die in real life, you will just wake up in the body you went to sleep in.  In this facility the queen allegedly loved to see people and children get slaughtered in a large dirt pit stadium  they had there. They can kill you multiple times and just create another clone for you to be in. You can still feel pain as a clone how you normally would. He described how the queen would threaten people with torture if they didn’t do what she wanted (such as a child refusing to sword fight to the death another child). The queen apparently likes being a clone more than real life and goes on power trips in the clone facility. The queen also likes watching horses being dismembered alive because of the screams they make. Donald Marshall was kept alive because he made a massive amount of music for the illuminati and they would torture him to write it. The song bigger than us by white lies was written by Donald marshal about how princess Diana was assassinated by the queen and royal family. One lyric is “ you went where the horses cry you’ve never gone that way with me before did you feel the need for change“. Diana asked her driver if he felt the need for change when he didn’t use the route she always asked for. Donald Marshall was keeping a paper trail of things he had learned in the facility in his songs.

395,hnsul7i,TheDiamondsSystem,"""Oh! The trees are different. OP must be smoking something strong. It ain't like log cabins are a one in a million thing."" Then I remembered it's hardly ever that simple and zoomed in. The wall is closer to the edge of the frame in Epstein's pic. Which means that it's a very slightly different angle or closer up. We're going to go with different angle since you can't see the crosses in the window pane in the queen's pic. If the window didn't get replaced, then the queen is actually closer. All of that means that the pine tree, if it's still there after all these years, would be covered by the wall in the more recent picture, and the hill in Epstein's pic would look bigger (Another main issue I had at first glance). The knots in the wall are the same. Not even just the obvious split that I saw someone else comment about, but ALL the cracks in *each individual log* are the same when you can look past the lighting. I will be the first to admit that we might be considered legally blind at this point, but I think even the dining set in the background/inside the cabin is the same. So, yes OP.

The epicenter of this collision- the new world and the old world order- is home based in the British Isles/Caribbean. Even France still holds islands there.

Surely that’s been happening since time immemorial and will continue to happen ad infinitum.

He raised an estimated £40 million for charities and, during his lifetime, was widely praised for his personal qualities and as a fund-raiser. After his death, hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse were made against him, leading the police to conclude that Savile had been a predatory sex offender—possibly one of Britain's most prolific.

The last Queen of England was [Queen Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain) who, with the 1707 Acts of Union, dissolved the title of King/Queen of England.

####FAQ

*Isn't she still also the Queen of England?*

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

814,hntc8n7,Noctisomnia,"It IS a setup, even this post. The people in the forefront are patsies and to make it beleivable they likely don't know they're being used. Just rich, bored and easily suseptable to the nudges they get, to commit evil acts and get away with so much so that when it comes out we are horrified. It is engraned in our nature (for survival if nothing else) as a herd mentality, to never accept the harm of children. So whomever is behind this whole thing is playing on that. Those of us who already have been working on this for years and years know all about those horrific nightmaric things and when it comes out people will revolt. It's also playing on our tribalism and working on division. That's why you had so much push on riots in a time when we should've naturally came together against a common enemy like a sickness etc.

The ones who are incredibly smart, don't seek fame. The ones who are behind this are evil that have convinced themselves they are good.  Either athiest and feel the need to conserve resources for themselves or likely in direct opposition to God and I honestly think even they don't know what else is really pulling their strings. They like to pat themselves on the back by slipping truths out, likely due to some law amongst themselves or for a game of chase. Squid Game ( spoiler) portrayed that the old man who orchestrated the game was actually amongst the players.

They use us as well like in Bird Box when the conspiracy theorists help spread their agenda. The ultimate story in my incomplete opinion, is that a group of truly elite, hidden from all are running the show and it's not Elon Musk, a President or the Queen of England. It's probably some dude behind a camera. Some scruffy looking woman watching from a crowd that calls something out to get it going.

Imagine what happens once we find out that our governments have been doing horrific shit to children and have taken bribes etc and will be responsible for poisoning half our loved ones with the shots . We will go mad with rage and revolt agianst them. The good guys will become the bad guys. A charismatic leader will come in to give direction to the majority which is us despite being made to feel like we're alone, it's actually us. They already have the souls and minds or at least the dead bodies of the weak. The ones they are really after are those who haven't been lead to slaughter both literally and spiritually. What better way than to turn us into self righteous, hate filled murderers out for revenge for what they did to our loved ones and the innocent. We will consider ourselves like William Wallace removing the heads of English cunts. And granted they are cunts, but not the right ones who will be play fighting right along side us and we will be funneled right into the trap. To the mark, to the one world religion, to the real new world order.

Test the theory yourself against anything. It's actually brilliant and I would expect nothing less from those who have had the access to anythign this planet has to offer for far too long and got bored or went insane from the power. It's really quite a great plot I mean look at the left/right paradigm and how well set up it is for each side to view the other as completley fucked. For me at least, the pieces keep filling in with this theory. If you want my advice don't follow any leader that isn't Christ. Remember his teachings. Love our enemies, be forgiving. Go into the country and make our heaven on earth. Our own communities. Keep the local hospitals and health tech but get rid of systems like insurance, throw away all black screens. This is the only way to disrupt them in my opinion and what is really going on. My eyes watered up when I saw so many of you asking what I was thinking in silence when I saw Andrew's stupid face with his arm around that girl. Who's really taking and collecting all these pictures?

Killing Epstein not only meant all his knowledge would go to the grave with him, it also sent a message to Ghislaine about what will happen to her if she rats on anyone in this trial.

They want this trial to put an end to this saga in the public consciousness but in a relatively muted way. 

I’m shocked at how many people say things like, “I’m not following the trial because it’s too hard to think about.” Like, what the fuck?!?! Weak willed pieces of shit. Basically complicit by refusing to demand public accountability, barely even care enough to want to make Ghislaine the scapegoat for everything (of course, she is guilty af for a lot of horrible shit, but not the whole tentacled monstrosity that touches all those in Epstein’s black books). Hell, that’s *why* Epstein was able to get away with all this shit for so long.

The point of running an escort agency wasn't to catch predators, but to gleen information from them. Young girls being trafficked is a tiny price to pay. 

So maxwell had means and opportunity to pick up her fathers network in information gathering. I don't think we need to go as far as ""the Royal family drinks blood"".

Survival could also mean a colony outside earth or it could mean on earth in a bunker to survive an event. If you run your own small survival group for the elite you also need control/blackmail and Epstein provided that too.

Trump and Epstein are the defendants.

Edit 2: fixed.

If you don’t want to look for the important bits I’ll paste them here:

Defendant Trump initiated sexual contact with Plaintiff at four different parties. On the fourth and final sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied Plaintiff to a bed, exposed himself to Plaintiff, and then proceeded to forcibly rape Plaintiff. During the course of this savage sexual attack, Plaintiff loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but with no effect. Defendant Trump responded to Plaintiff’s pleas by violently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted. Exhs. A and B.
11. Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened Plaintiff that, were she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse of her by Defendant Trump, Plaintiff and her family would be physically harmed if not killed.

The problem is the story broke and it went viral, and the intel agencies then decided it was in their best interest to suicide him before any news media could get their hands on him and possibly leak information that would expose their extremely useful blackmail network.

Maxwell probably had closer connections to Mossad or the CIA due to her father's/family's connections and power, so they told her ""Look, just shut your mouth and we'll get you through this. If you don't spill any important info, you'll live out the rest of your days like Martha Stewart, in some sort of an extremely high class / lax private jail.""

They willingly gave up their guns. Then, their rights started to disappear. Then, they started to get people to rat out their neighbors for not conforming to the nazi regime. Then they convinced them of the supremacy of the Aryan race. And those that didn't go with it, were coerced, threatened, used as an example through torture, death of family members, until the regime gained the power they had to round up whoever they wanted with little resistance. The lower ranks of the nazi regime ""were just following orders."" The camps started out as a sort of ""safe space"" until propaganda set in. This is common knowledge. Any library holds these first-hand accounts. The news stories. The investigations. Yet people forget all about the crap that happened BEFORE the holocaust started. And Gina Carano simply brought it back to light, and her career was destroyed because of it. I'm not comparing camps to this. Nobody is. Those camps are ingrained into our brains. It's the events leading up to those notorious death camps that people seem to forget about. THAT is the problem.

And there’s a consistent unsound tone of it. It’s a lot of proxy stuff not directly related but projected. And projecting stance from proxy issues is like what bias is. It has a functional place, but it’s not a solid logical foundation. If your disagreement with a value is a media optics character judgement, based on assigned authority roles and their character alone, you kind of miss the point of having personal values. You can just have an opinion on something without making it about proxy elements that can be embarrassing bullshit casually consumed and regurgitated.",t1_hvwe532,6,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,smbfer

It’s also scary how many people don’t understand that the Russian people can’t oppose their government the same way that we can. Young men are forced to serve in the military, and people can literally go to jail for just opposing Putin - if you just pay a little bit more attention, you can see how many Russians oppose this war. How big the protests are, and how the soldiers seem to be doing everything they can to avoid conflict with the Ukrainian citizens (e.g. the way the soldier speaks to the “sunflower seeds in your pockets” woman).

The massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia (Polish: rzeź wołyńska, lit. 'Volhynian slaughter'; Ukrainian: Волинська трагедія, romanized: Volynska trahediia, lit. 'Volyn tragedy'), were carried out in German-occupied Poland by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, or the UPA, with the support of parts of the local Ukrainian population against the Polish minority in Volhynia, Eastern Galicia, parts of Polesia and Lublin region from 1943 to 1945.[4] The peak of the massacres took place in July and August 1943. Most of the victims were women and children.[5] Many of the Polish victims regardless of age or gender were tortured before being killed; some of the methods included rape, dismemberment or immolation, among others.[6] The UPA's actions resulted in between 50,000[1] and 100,000 deaths",t3_t8blha,-6,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,t8blha

I just recently finished the book Pure, White and Deadly. Written in the 70s. They did EVERYTHING to try and destroy that man’s credibility. Now it’s Robert Lustig following in his footsteps in the quest to expose how insidious the sugar industry is. And he had no idea about John Yudkin because back when he put out his book, he got smeared so much that he became unheard of. 

Robert Lustig’s newest book talks about how it’s hard to get out the truth with the govt having such power.

However, those found guilty of using “an official position” – for which they are remunerated – to spread “false information” face between 5 to 10 years in prison and a fine of up up to 5 million rubles ($44,000). “If the fake information caused serious consequences, the term of imprisonment will be from 10 to 15 years,” TASS reports.

TASS also reported that those who publicly call on Russia to stop the use of its armed forces or publicly call for foreign sanctions on Russia massive fines and potentially imprisonment. The latter, in particular, would result in potentially a fine worth three years’ wages, imprisonment for up to six months or “forced labor for a term of up to three years.””",t1_hznnuzg,45,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,t8blha

And didn't Zelensky then win against the president that came after Yanukovych with 71% of the vote, implying that Ukraine basically ousted the neo Nazi leaders?

Ukraine also ranks highly amongst countries that are accepting of Jews, especially among the Slavic countries. 

Also, there are pictures of the Taliban in the oval office and every US president since Woodrow Wilson has basically been accepting of bombing kids, so of course I'm not surprised that there is a terrorist group shaking hands with a US president. 

I mean, the US has committed so many atrocities that it doesn't even matter anymore when they sell weapons to Saudi Arabia to blow up Yemeni schools. 

In fact, I would assume that's one of the reasons why the US was so hesitant on selling weapons to Ukraine, cause they weren't blowing up kids.

Now the US has basically joined the bandwagon to claim some moral superiority over Russia. It's all a game, as can be seen by the two Republicans who tweeted they were on a call with the Ukrainian president after he asked everyone on the call to not share any information. It's literally just a game for the US. I wouldn't be surprised if Biden lied he'd been to Ukraine and talked to Zelensky in person. 

Then of course the US has a former president that wanted to bomb Russians with US planes painted with Chinese colors. Which goes against the Geneva convention, but of course no one in the US really cares about that, or every president and US general since FDR and Eisenhower would have gone to the Hague to face their war crimes. 

And then there is also the fact that pretty much all countries in the west have a significant neo-nazi or really right wing movements, which is terrifying, cause they've been winning elections for the last 10 years in Europe and gaining a lot of tractions due to NATO countries destabilising middle Eastern countries and bombing them to shit to force people to flee to Europe, who are then unable to adjust to the societies quickly enough, so right wing parties can use them as scapegoats for everything wrong in their countries.

Even Russia is heavily against immigration and has a lot of right wing groups that are borderline neo Nazis. Claiming that white people are superior and shit like that, while supporting genocides in countries like China and Syria. The US is on the same boat, refusing to acknowledge the Kurdish genocide in Syria and the Uighur genocides in China. 

Then we have the Congo, which saw a massive genocide by Belgians, but no one has acknowledged that. Including Russia. Or Ukraine.

At this point, I'm just so fucking sick and tired of innocent people being killed and imperial powers invading other countries to maintain some power and wealth for the leadership. 

I honestly see little to no difference between Putin and Biden as both promise shit to their people and have gained enormous wealth from being in power of their respective countries. The billionaires in the US and billionaires in Russia are cut from the same cloth and control the show, forcing people to kill each other in order to gain more land, wealth and power, cause it's the only way these obscenely wealthy people can get a hard on anymore. It's literally just a numbers game for them. Who can provide the most suffering with the least backlash...

Putin can eat shit. He is a shitty person and refusing to acknowledge that is no different from ignoring Obama's bombing runs.

those net worths youre giving are an estiamte on what he SHOULD own with the assumption he was making money legally

putin by contrast - his net worth isnt an estimate based on what he earned but what he mysteriously owned without any known methods to actually pay for it

and the joy of it all is you can say the stuff youre saying - even if its bullshit it doesnt matter - you dont have to be afraid of the police like you would be in russia

there are whole websites and news agencies devoted to that kind of stuff and they keep going

685,hzokcbe,,">They were protesting against being undemocratically ordered to do something. Just like this invasion/special military operation stuff, it's all in the wording - the media were reporting the protest using very specific words to make people assume the truckers are anti-vax, and so many people fell for it without bothering to think about the long term implications.

First of all, it's the democratically elected people who make the laws and this is one of them. If you don't like it, vote. If you don't get majority vote, too bad. The vaccine mandates are supported by a majority of people and they are not oppressing anyone (unless you think having your feelings hurt are oppressive. Maybe go get a kiss from mama on the little booboo). 

Second, are you really gonna equate this to the Russian invasion into Ukraine?

>This time it was about being mandated to take a vaccine, next time it'll be about being mandated to do something you don't believe in but it won't matter, the precedent has been set. You can still protest as long as it's quiet and ineffective or they'll shut you down, freeze your bank account and send you home, legally, because they were allowed to bypass democracy and implement laws that allow them to do it this time. Protesting is still allowed until there's a risk of it being effective, i.e. protesting is worthless.

Canada is one of the freeest countries in the world. It regularly hits the top 10 in terms of freedom and continues to rise. 

I've been called a terrorist by the UK for refusing to pay the bill of the Icelandic banks. If you believe in your cause, this kind of small stuff won't stop you. 

>IMO, it was worth fighting against whatever your stance on vaccines, even if you don't live in Canada, because other countries will certainly learn how to use Canada's playbook to control their own democracies. Honking a few horns at night was trivial given the implications for your freedom, and it's a shame so many people fell for the media wording.

I'd rather fight for a worthy cause than a dumb one. A vaccine mandate doesn't apply to your own homes. Go be free there. If you don't like the rules, just move. Isn't that what right wing conspiracy nuts tend to say when things start to go their way and people begin to oppose it?

So why even be against it?

Outside the community things became very dangerous and I think that scared them and feel safer inside the community. Another thing that has change is that the more modern Mennonites now have guns and weapons. The Mennonite traditions does not allowed that, but as I said things in that region have become very violent that lots had to change to survive.

yellen was picked for the same reason she was hired by those banks - because she knows the system like the back of her hand 

and obama is so super popular internationally - i know plenty of people who are planning on buying his book

and you do see corruption - republican ted cruz had his campaign buy a bunch of his own books for example which appears to be embezzlement but not to the degree of blatency which would permit a conviction

theres a lot of corruption like that in the trump republican sphere - you have to remember trump even granted pardons to people who were convicted for embezzling from his own supporters

the key is that in america you can point out to those shady cases that could be considered corruption - you can look at ted cruz or janet yellen and say 'this guy is a crook' or 'we should pick a different person to regulate' and you can campaign on that

in russia they dont even have the right to do that because its far too corrupt.  theres no paper trail on the money they get and you cant even lobby for a paper trail

you dont want to bow your head to people like that - people like putin or trump who cover up their paper trails and then call for the arrests of anybody who wants to investigate their shady business

Not to mention, vaccines regardless of which virus they come from the same advanced researches. It's simply just different methods to get there, most of which are pretty safe and secure. The most modern vaccines are also far better since they can be changed more easily to fit each disease, meaning less research time is necessary.

Giuffre Said Trump Did Not Abuse Her or Other Underage Girls, to Her Knowledge  
One of the unsealed documents is a deposition of Giuffre in which she says Maxwell directed her to have sex with Britain’s Prince Andrew and former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, among other prominent men. (Buckingham Palace has put out a statement denying this. Richardson’s spokesperson also denied this in a statement to CNBC, saying, “These allegations and inferences are completely false.”)  
  
In a partial transcript of her deposition on November 14, 2016, Giuffre is asked to identify errors in statements attributed to her by reporter Sharon Churcher. Giuffre put check marks next to a handful of claims on a list, indicating that she took issue with them. She put a check next to this statement: “Donald Trump was also a good friend of Jeffrey’s. He didn’t partake in any sex with any of us but he flirted with me. He’d laugh and tell Jeffrey, ‘you’ve got the life.’”  
  
Giuffre was asked to explain what was wrong with the statement.  
  
A: “Donald Trump was also a good friend of Jeffrey’s.” That part is true. “He didn’t partake in any” of — “any sex with any of us but he flirted with me.” It’s true that he didn’t partake in any sex with us, but it’s not true that he flirted with me. Donald Trump never flirted with me.

The basic limitation period is two years – a person must commence an action within two years of when he or she first knew that a claim could be made. Normally, this would be two years after the claimant suffered the injury or the damage that was the subject of the claim.

In civil cases, such as personal injury cases, the date when the limitation period starts to run is extremely important. Sometimes it is not the exact date of the occurrence of the accident or injury. For example, the date can be that when the injury or loss is first discovered or, alternatively, it can begin on the date when it first becomes clear that the person injured has recourse against the party that caused or contributed to their injuries.

However, there are exceptions. 

The two year limitation period in Ontario does not apply if the person injured is not represented by a litigation guardian and is:

a minor (under 18 at the time of occurrence of the event); or

LGBT was the same to an extent, as even a lot of gay people do not like the LGBT because it pushes extremist queer theory. 

Feminism is the absolute worst because it tries to turn women against men or at least make them fearful of us. And also to make men feel ashamed of themselves just like how BLM tries to make White people ashamed of their heritage (which in reality is not at all something to be ashamed of) in order to ultimately shut us up and force us to work against our own people's interest's in favour of elitists and corporatists alike (great reset - ""you will own nothing and be happy"" ie the Marxist expulsion of private property = personal freedom/liberty). 

All organisations that keep us distracted from tackling what is really not even a class war, but a fight between good and evil forces in our world (I don't believe all wealthy people are bad otherwise what shall we aspire to? How else can we help our communities?)

I understand the sentiment because my grandparents used to have them. My parents definitely had them for a long time too, given their upbringing. You just have to understand that there were times you didn't live through, things that happened that you didn't experience. You didn't feel the way they felt about that group of people. So it's easy for you to say ""use your brain, be logical, be reasonable"", but war isn't reasonable. And they would respond ""were the other side reasonable when they raped and pillaged?"" 

Why isn't the blame on the USA or the soldiers who went over in the first place? There's a clear chain of causation here and you're nitpicking at one act of wrongdoing, when there were MANY fucked up circumstances that caused them to think that way.

If you're ever in a war, god forbid, you better damn well bet that you're gonna see the other side as monsters. Because that's what it's gonna take to kill them before they kill you - any softness or hesitation could lead to death.

Buying a Tesla in and of itself does not mean you are helping the environment! When you plug it into the wall to charge, that energy needs to come from somewhere. The Tesla charging stations are not magical energy boxes.

Gas combustion engines tend to be more energy efficient per mile. The energy is produced directly inside the engine rather than conducting it over miles and miles of power lines and into an inefficient battery. (Ie. A gallon of gas in a combustion engine will take you further than putting that same gallon of gas in a generator and charging your Tesla with it.) The real positives for the environment come from the fact that the electric car can utilize electricity that comes from cleaner energy sources, such as wind/solar/nuclear instead of petroleum. For a lot of the US, this isn’t an issue as a lot of states are phasing out coal/petroleum for cleaner sources.

But if you live in a state that still gets most of its energy from coal, then your Tesla is actually worse for the environment in the long run.

 Or, to use the example of plastic bottles, the vast majority of consumers probably believe that plastic bottles are recyclable, even though they really aren't.   The reason that consumers believe this is because oil companies and food stuff companies combined to sell us that lie, because it made sales for oil companies and made production cheaper for food companies.

Not until you manage to convince half of consumers in the Western world that they've been lied to and that they are wrong about something, and that they've been wrong about it for 40 years,  which is an incredible lift and at this point the inertia caused by the information gradient and the lie that created it probably makes that impossible.",t1_inbhcxy,13,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,x7bs74

>However it doesn't detract from the point I was making that while we as private individuals & households are being guilted for our relatively small carbon footprints, there are other far larger transgressors.

It does though. All of that carbon footprint needs to be attributed to the purchasers of those things that are being shipped. If a ship uses 100MT of bunker fuel to carry 100 items that people purchase, the emissions of 1MT need to be attributed to the purchaser of each of those 100 items since those items wouldn't have been shipped and that fuel wouldnt have been spent if not for the consumers who bought those things.

No, the responsibility is on the person purchasing. If, as a people, we want to make carbon positive profit impossible, then we need to elect people who will make taxes that will be passed onto the end user sufficient to completely discourage carbon positive behaviour.

>As individuals we don't get to say how things are done; industry & government decided that between themselves.

If tomorrow everyone stopped buying all carbon positive things, those companies would change to no longer be carbon positive.

>That it took until 2020 to do something about bunker fuel says a lot to me; it's been over 20 years since the UK's road fuel went low or zero sulphur, but fwiw I can remember seeing documentaries about acid rain & other environmental pollution issues as far back as the early '80s, maybe even the late '70s. There's been far too much time wasted procrastinating and delaying, more could have done sooner, sulphur in particular has been a 'known' for decades, half a century even.

It took so long because the fuel to meet the 2020 cap didnt exist even as recently as 2017. All the fuel production was rigged to produce 3.5% IFO.",t1_indh27n,1,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,x7bs74

Timeline:

1) FBI raids apartment, using a warrent that apparently lets them do the raid, but not take anything found in his safe

2) During the raid, they open the safe (in spite of not being able to confiscate the contents)

3) They pull a stash of CDroms from the safe, but since their warrant does not authorize them to take the contents of the safe, they stack the CDs on top of it

4) They leave, and file for a new warrent to take the contents of the safe

5) They return some time later (days?) only to find that the stack of CDs is gone. Oops

My theory: CDs containing damning evidence against any number of people were known to be stored within the safe, but Epstein had set the combination himself and only he had the combination. It was inevitable that the safe would be accessed during a raid, and the house was under surveillance so getting someone in to crack the safe was not feasible. Instead, key players utilized assets within the FBI to get the limited warrant, use FBI resources to crack the safe as part of the raid and set the CDs out, then used their people on the inside (like housing staff) to discreetly remove the CDs",t1_hqtfec0,24,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,rtm3ip

""Raise your hand if you want Ghislaine Maxwell to squeal on every man that Epstein sex trafficked young girls and women too, no matter who they may be.""

In here we have the phrases/words ""every man,"" and ""young girls,"" and ""women,"" and ""too.""

If the tweet said ""...squeal on every man and woman that Epstein trafficked young girls to [notice ""to"" instead of ""too""],"" it would mean the ones receiving the trafficked girls were both men and women.

If it said ""...squeal on every man that Epstein trafficked young girls and women to [""to"" instead of ""too""],"" it would mean Epstein only trafficked to men, and the victims were only young girls and women.

If it said, ""...squeal on every man that Epstein trafficked young girls to, [notice comma and ""to"" usage] and to women too [""too"" instead of ""to""]..."" then it would mean Epstein trafficked young girls to men, and also to women.

But alas, it's Twitter and the person tweeting this likely doesn't know or care much for those sorts of differentiations. Anything that's poorly written will often have ambiguous meanings, hence multiple people interpreting it in different ways.

441,hqwxuo6,ARocketToMars,"Cool, so you didn't go through any of the information I gave you. 


Regarding the article, it says the ""original"" telemetry tapes were lost. For a single mission. Out of the 27 (launched) missions of the Apollo program. The data was recorded and copied and otherwise documented elsewhere. Notice how the article never says the information from the lost data was inaccessible, or not documented. Just that the original form of the data (again, from a single mission out of 27. Apollo 11 is **one** mission, not the whole program) isn't present. Like how you can watch a digital copy of Casablanca, but not the original film negatives. If you bothered to get through more than the headline of the article you sent, you'd know that since it goes out of its way to explain that. Direct quotes from the article you sent, since you missed it: 

>""There was no video that came down slow scan that was not converted live, fed live, to Houston and fed live to the world,"" Nafzger said at press conference showing some of the restored footage in 2009. ""So, just in case anyone thinks there is video out there that hasn’t been seen, that is not the case."" 

___

> ""...We had tapes recorded in Sydney, Australia, during the mission. (We) found kinescopes at the National Archives that had not been viewed in 36 years that were made in Houston. We went to CBS archives and we found tapes that had been fed directly from Houston to CBS . .. . the raw data as recorded and archived.”

Regarding the van Allen belts, they were a problem then, they are a problem now. But they're a solvable problem. The difference between now and then in solving the problem is primarily in computing. Digital computers are more sensitive to ionizing radiation than analog computers, and require different shielding. We use digital computing now, they used a along computing back then. [Here](https://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s2ch3.htm) is an article explaining the radiation environment more thoroughly, and detailing the exact amount of radiation encountered by the Apollo crews. Most ionizing alpha and beta particles from the van Allen belts can be dispersed enough to be safe for humans with relatively thin sheets of metal. The outer walls of the Apollo capsules were a stainless steel honeycomb between plates of stainless steel, further insulated with fiberglass. The inner walls were an aluminum honeycomb welded to an inner and outer aluminum skin. That's more than adequate to stop the majority of radiation. 

Also, the van Allen belts are exactly that: belts. Shielding aside, the worst parts of them can be avoided fairly easily with the right orbital inclination (that is, tilt of the orbit relative to Earth and the belts), and traversing them quickly enough.



Regarding the video clip, interpret that as ""we destroyed the technology to go to the moon [in a manner identical to Apollo]"". He's essentially saying the processes for making moon rockets have been entirely dismantled, and it's a pain to get them going again. Zero mention of the tapes from him though, so not sure where you got that. And he's a former astronaut doing an interview, not an analyst. 

As in, supply lines have been entirely shut down and dismantled. Suppliers and contractors are essentially entirely different companies, and aren't producing anything remotely similar to what they were 60 years ago. The global supply chain from the 1960's literally does not exist any more. Factories were shuttered or are working on entirely different programs these days. Machining methods, metallurgy, and the types of materials used are completely different. We use digital computers now rather than analog. The methods used for design and testing and integration are completely different. Safety considerations are different. Technology has significantly advanced and just the pure method for building a rocket is completely different. 

That's the technology that was destroyed.  You have to take the question he was asked in the context of the conversation. He answered it literally. Notice how the specific question he was asked is conspicuously absent from your video, because if it was included it would destroy the narrative. Notice how you're *told* what he was asked, but not allowed to hear it for yourself. If it was presented unedited, his meaning would be much clearer. Notice how the narrative that the tech was ""accidentally"" destroyed was inserted, even though that's not what was said at all. Notice how whoever makes these videos has to pause the quote every 2 seconds to tell you what to think, and make sure you get their narrative, and insert their commentary (and commentary from an actor, as if he's any authority on the subject) to lead you to the ""right"" conclusion, rather than give you all the context and information to form an opinion yourself. (I'm not even going to touch the fact that your video outright says nobody has even been to space; you can see the space station and crewed capsules arriving at it from the ground with decent binoculars or an [iphone with a zoom lens](https://i.redd.it/6zu77ruawtp71.png))

Very very condensed version: the claim that all of the technology and tapes were somehow lost is entirely untrue. 

The ""lost technology"" refers to the specific methods and supply lines used to construct a moon rocket in the 1960's no longer being active in the modern day. Different eras, different tech, etc. For example we 3D print rocket parts these days; much different from the by-hand tooling of mid 20th century. 

The ""lost tapes"" refers to the original telemetry from a single launch of the Apollo program (out of 27 total). But it's just the originals. The data was already documented, copied, and otherwise recorded elsewhere, so it's hardly lost.

35,hy47v9a,ruove,"I have found that most of reddit, and presumably most of twitter, has no clue what insider trading is. Insider trading is not simply having information the general public doesn't have.

Illegal ""*insider trading,*"" and trading on material non-public information, are two very separate things, but that seem the same to those unfamiliar with them.

Example: Many people/hedge funds get material non-public information (read: inside information) in ways which are perfectly legal. For example, they meet privately with management, or commission researchers to examine products or company locations, or go to industry conferences, or lots of other things. This is all legal ""*insider information.*""

To be illegal insider trading, material non-public information **must have been obtained via a breach of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence.** So if you give a CFO a suitcase full of cash for early access to earnings numbers, you’re in trouble.
