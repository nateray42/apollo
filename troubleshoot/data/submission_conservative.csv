qqsaqy,MultiStratz,"Admission that I was wrong, and y'all were right about Rittenhouse","I believed Rittenhouse was absolutely in the wrong,  but after the Prosecution's stunning defense of the kid, I must admit that I was wrong. I think this is a pretty clear cut case of self defense on Kyle's part, and I shouldn't have made a judgement before having all the facts. Kyle had a gun pointed at him by a man who had previously threatened him- I can't say I'd have done much different.

So here's me eating crow!

-your friendly 2A liberal

Edit: this is really blowing up, and I can't respond to everyone- I'm sorry!
I wrote this post to admit that I made a mistake; I appreciate the commenters who have been respectful and helpful in their responses.

To the people making fun of me,  calling me a communist, blaming me for the woes of this country: that's not going to win anyone to your side.   I'm not here to argue or debate, just admit that I was wrong on this issue. I wish you and your families the very best!

Edit 2: I'm so overwhelmed with the response to this. I had written a rather angry diatribe here, but decided to delete it.  Some redditors said some pretty nasty things to me, both conservatives, and liberals. It got under my skin, but I'd rather focus on the **many** awesome conservatives who have engaged in civil discourse with me. I've learned much from listening to you all. 

Edit 3: Yes, I saw the videos- I felt they were missing context. That context was explained in court, and I see where I was wrong.  
Everyone is asking why I believed Kyle was in the wrong here:
I felt that he put himself in a situation that he wasn't prepared for,  with a rifle he didn't legally aquire. From my perspective, that looked an awful lot like someone who went to a riot *looking* for an opportunity to use the gun.  The reality is that,  while I think he shouldn't have been there,  the asshole he killed was following him around harassing and threatening him.  I can't fault Kyle for defending himself, and its not my place to determine his motives. Hope that makes sense. I understand from talking with some of you here that Kyle was there to protect his community, and I can accept that his motives were good, though ill advised IMO.

w59qpb,FartingTacos,Why vote against HR 8373? (Birth Control Bill),"Okay, my ignorance is showing.

I'm looking at HR 8373 and having a difficult time reading it because all I hear in my head is Nancy Pelosi's shrill voice as if she were reading the dang thing.

[https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8373/text?r=1&s=1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8373/text?r=1&s=1)

Why would anyone vote against the bill? 

I've been a conservative my entire life, and even I would support something that ensure that a contraceptive was available to anyone who wanted *""actual""* family planning services. 

Are people concerned that Abortions would be considered contraceptives? Is it a gateway drung kind of situation?

I've got to be missing something here.

sn5hf8,BIG_BOTTOM_TEXT,"""Racist"" is the new ""Witch""","In colonial America and prior, people would often accuse those they suspected of malice of being a witch.  And in fact there were practicing witches...but very...VERY few of them, and they were isolated to low-resource tiny, fringe groups of mentally ill outcasts.  Despite this, the call of ""Witch!"" was a potent unifier for the Wokest of the Woke in Puritan society.

Fast forward to the present day: people often accuse those they suspect of malice of being a racist.  And in fact there are practicing racists...but very...VERY few of them, and they are isolated to low-resource tiny, fringe groups of mentally ill outcasts.  Despite this, the call of ""Racist!"" is a potent unifier for the Wokest of the Woke in Progressive society.

Funny how history repeats itself....

EDIT: It's come up a couple times now in the comments how ""witches were burned and stoned, etc. and racists face nothing like that today.""

To me, it seems overwhelmingly obvious why that is, so I didn't bother writing it out, but if this is your stance, I'd like you to note ***nobody*** is burned or stoned anymore in Western culture.  (This) society has moved past that behavior, as a whole.  So the fact that witches were brutally killed in the past vs how alleged (often not actual) racists today ""merely"" have their entire livelihoods destroyed is a product of hundreds of years of civil development and does not reflect in the slightest on the animosity ppl feel towards those they label as 'evil' based on zero bona fide evidence.",283,2478,0.68,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/sn5hf8/racist_is_the_new_witch/
