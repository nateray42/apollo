wjoj1w,PoliticsModeratorBot,Megathread: FBI Searches Former President Donald Trump's Florida Home,"Former President Donald J. Trump said on Monday that the F.B.I. had searched his Palm Beach, Fla., home and had broken open a safe — an account that, if accurate, would be a dramatic escalation in the various investigations into the former president. The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. The discovery of classified information at Mar-a-Lago was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

Jackson Women's Health Organization, on the constitutionality of pre-viability abortion bans. The Court ruled 6–3 that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overturning both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and returning ""the authority to regulate abortion"" to the states.

Justice Alito delivered the majority opinion, joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Justices Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice Roberts each filed concurring opinions, while Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan dissented.
