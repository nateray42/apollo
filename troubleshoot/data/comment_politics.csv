23,hyo59bo,inoveryourtoes,"I’ve been going over some of the Trump era rhetoric toward NATO. The 2018 summit got lost with all the other drama, but this bit is pretty prescient:

> This past July, on the final day of the nato summit in Brussels, Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, proposed a closed-door emergency meeting. The emergency was Donald Trump. Minutes earlier, the President had arrived late to a session where the **Presidents of Ukraine and Georgia were making their case to join nato**. Trump interrupted their presentation and unleashed a verbal assault on the members of the alliance, calling them deadbeats and free riders on American power. Trump threatened to go his “own way” if they didn’t immediately pay more for their own defense. His barrage centered on Merkel, Europe’s longest-serving democratic leader.

Trumo was looking for excuses to sour the US’s opinion of NATO, and idiots ate that up. He was undermining the alliance that is Putin’s number one problem. And what a coincidence that this outburst comes just as Ukraine and Georgia are making their case for membership. Hmmm….

> “You, Angela,” Trump chided Merkel. Most of nato’s members had failed to fulfill the goal of spending two per cent of G.D.P. for defense, but Trump focussed on Germany’s military spending of just over one per cent of G.D.P. In front of television cameras the previous day, he had accused Germany of being “totally controlled by Russia,” because of a proposed new gas pipeline. His tweets that day sounded like blackmail. “What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.”

In fact, the [US trade deficit with Europe had gone up during Trump’s tenure, and Europe had upped their NATO spending prior to Trump taking office](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/12/factchecking-trumps-nato-remarks/). Under Trump, it continued to go up, but they were under no obligation to do so and they had been doing that of their own accord. They didn’t owe us anything. 

>And yet, when he emerged from the meeting and spoke with reporters, Trump lied, claiming not only that his allies had capitulated to him but also that they would consider his demand to raise their annual military spending to four per cent of G.D.P., an assertion so politically impossible that Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, immediately issued a public rebuttal. Trump, of course, went on behaving in his erratic, inexplicable manner. As he left the summit, he interrupted the Chancellor while she was addressing her fellow nato leaders, and kissed her. “I love this woman,” he said. “Isn’t she great?” A senior German official who told me about that particular Trumpian flourish resisted any attempt at full understanding. “It’s up to psychologists and historians what to make of that,” he said. Four days later, Trump ended his European tour in Helsinki. There, standing next to Vladimir Putin, he spoke with bewildering sympathy for Russian foreign policy, ill-concealed contempt for his nato partners, and implausible skepticism about his own intelligence services.

So Trump didn’t help our trade deficits with the EU, and NATO spending had been steadily increasing prior to his taking office. He verbally assaulted our allies and demeaned the NATO organization, causing it to lose stature and be seen as faltering or weak.

He didn’t care about Nord Stream, he cared about pissing Merkel off and he used their energy independence as a pretext for doing that. His sanction of a small Swiss firm who was working on a tiny fraction of the pipeline did nothing to stop the project. 

His rantings were counter-productive and ineffectual, unless you’re a Russian. When you look back over Trump’s record on NATO, knowing what we do about Putin’s obesssive hatred for the alliance, his actions seem decidedly traitorous.",t3_t2suj2,21,politics,t5_2cneq,t2suj2

Aid: To help; support; assistance; counsel; encouragement. As an element in the crime of treason, the giving of “aid and comfort” to the enemy may consist in a mere attempt.   
  
To render assistance, bolster or counsel. Any act that deliberately strengthens or tends to strengthen enemies of the United States, or that weakens or tends to weaken the power of the United States to resist and attack such enemies is characterized as aid and comfort.

344,hypmhsd,PuddingEcstatic4142,"This has always been a part of the Russian elite's plans. Check out the book, [Foundations of Geopolitics by Aleksandr Dugin] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics), which is a book that details how Russia should approach increasing their sphere of influence. Finland's section reads:

""Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be ""donated to Murmansk Oblast"".""

Finland will be next after this Ukraine crisis. At the section for Ukraine it reads:

""Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because ""Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics"". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible.""

Their plan for the US is to:

""fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S.""

Think about [""Russian troll farms""] (https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/.../troll-farms-and-fake-news...) that continually stir things up on different social media platforms to get us, the American people, to be at each other's throats over such trivial things. Think about what it says for the UK:

""The United Kingdom, merely described as an ""extraterritorial floating base of the U.S."", should be cut off from Europe.""

and then think about how more research is coming out to show that [Russian troll farms played a part in the Brexit vote as well] (https://www.npr.org/2019/01/19/686830510/senate-finds-russian-bots-bucks-helped-push-brexit-vote-through). People treat them like ""trolls"" & not foreign digital attacks on the people of other nations aiming to cause instability.

This needs to be a wake up call. This is Putin's game plan for the world. MAKE NO MISTAKE, it isn't the Russian citizens who want this. It's the Russian elites, it's Putin & his oligarchs who want this. And they won't stop with Ukraine. It's just one step in their plan.",t3_t2suj2,2,politics,t5_2cneq,t2suj2

to US involvement and comparing the invasion of the Ukraine to the 2003 Iraq  
war. Let’s just look at the facts.   
Facts  
1.We Attacked Iraq unprovoked. They did not attack us, nor  
did they want to fight us.  
2. We blatantly lied about WMDs. We clearly wanted to invade  
Iraq for geopolitical goals, and made about WMDs and other nonsense like  
""yellow cake"" to justify invading.  
3. When we attacked Iraq, we directly attacked civilian  
infrastructure. Many Iraqis went without electricity and water for more then a  
year.  
4. It is reported that more then 185,000–208,000 civilian  
deaths occurred because of the Iraq war.  
5.The Iraq war destabilized the religion, and Iraqi  
Christians were forced to leave when ISIS showed up. They lived there for  
thousands of years.  
I am not saying all this to be a bleeding heart liberal. I'm very conservative. I  
did deploy to Iraq in a combat MOS, 13b, I was used as in a infantry capacity  
during the conflict and served near the Iraq Iran boarder. I just don't  
understand the ""we da good guys, they the bad guys"". Russia is  
clearly attacking the Ukraine for geopolitical reasons that serve Russian  
interests, much like the war in Iraq. Neither one of these wars meet the  
criteria of Christian just war doctrine. Democracy is not a prerequisite for  
moral just Christian society, nor does US foreign policy represent anything  
other than serving national interests, ""making the world safe for  
democracy"" is a propaganda term. Think its best that we put aside  
nationalist bias when looking at conflicts like these. So when I say that it  
looks like Russia is using restraint, I mean that in the context of recent  
unprovoked conflicts. That is not a compliant to Putin. This does not make me a  
Russian supporter. I am so sick of Jingoistic neolibs and neoconsertives. I pray for Russia and the Ukraine, this war needs to stop.",t3_t2suj2,-12,politics,t5_2cneq,t2suj2

Obama took advantage of that disconnect when the context of Romney’s comments got stripped away by the format.

* Praised Putin constantly, called him a ""strong leader"", has peddled statements like ""he's done a really great job outsmarting our country""
* Trump dismissed and cast doubt about Russian hacking, particularly when the U.S determined that Russia hacked the DNC in 2016, while ironically enough, he encouraged Russian cyber attacks on national TV saying, ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,""
* When addressing Russian election interference and cyber attacks, Trump proclaimed ""I don't see any reason why it would be Russia"" after speaking directly with Putin, defending Russia and trusting Putin over our own intelligence agencies. Later he ""corrected"" himself, claiming that he meant to say ""wouldn't"" instead of would.
* Trump suggested the U.S. work directly with Russia on cybersecurity. Trump refused to do anything about Russia's attack on Solar Winds.
* Almost directly after the 2016 election, Trump sought to weaken U.S. sanctions on Russia, while he was even open to lifting sanctions.
* Trump dismissed the notion that Putin was a ""killer"", downplaying the idea that Putin resorts to using violence and oppressive tactics to crush political opponents. He defended Putin, rationalizing his ruthless despotism in the process, declaring, ""There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?""
* Trump shared highly classified U.S. intelligence with Russian officials in the Oval Office in 2017.
* Trump repeated Kremlin talking points related to the Russian annexation of Crimea, reiterating things like, ""The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.""
* Trump constantly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin. (quite relevant)
* Trump thanked Putin for expelling hundreds of U.S. diplomats as a retaliation for sanctions.
* Trump refused to make a statement about the 10th anniversary of the Russia-Georgia war. According to John Bolton, European leaders noticed Trump's silence and ""became even more concerned about American resolve.""
* According to congressional testimony, Trump declined to publicly condemn a Russian attack against Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018, even though the State Department prepared a statement for him
* Trump congratulated and gave legitimacy to Putin's re election win in 2018, a victory said to ""lack genuine competition""
* Sergei Skripal, an ex Russian spy that defected to the UK, was poisoned. Sanctions were announced, Trump attempted to rescind them, while asserting that the U.S. was being ""too tough on Putin""
* When congress passed new sanctions against Russia in 2017, Trump was very reluctant to signing the bill, and probably wouldn't have signed it if the bill didn't pass with veto-proof majorities in both houses
* In 2017 it was reported that Trump was considering returning spy bases to Russia.
* Trump praised and highlighted pro-Russian leaders in Europe. Far right European leaders with close ties to Putin. He even met a Kremlin ally at the Whitehouse.
* When Trump withdrew troops from Syria, it gave Russia and Putin an opportunity to control abandoned U.S. outposts and checkpoints.
* Trump froze U.S. aide for Ukraine in it's war against Russian proxies. He repeated Russian disinformation surrounding Ukraine as well.
* Trump made requests to bring Russia back into the G7 and invited Putin to the 2020 G7 summit",t3_t11uq0,52,politics,t5_2cneq,t11uq0

There are more pro-Putin Republicans now in Congress as a result of his presidency so it's unclear these majorities would still exist if he had a 2nd term. It might already be too late though.

What has been concerning me though is something which I was concerned about during all of the Trump years: Diplomacy or more importantly, how Trump was actively fucking it up every day and bragging about it.

Biden can't do shit because Trump spent 4 years dismantling as many diplomatic relationships as possible, that took years to build and more than is even possible to keep track of, and giving every possible concession to the Russia. This was only going to be felt years down the line and this is just the first major instance. Trump was also openly hostile to Ukraine a few times pretty blantantly. Something like this would take years to properly plan and execute so I'm curious as to how much of US foreign policy under the Trump Administration actively worked towards putting this invasion into Russia's hands.",t3_t11uq0,4,politics,t5_2cneq,t11uq0

Trump refused to release the funds to Ukraine as he was pressuring the country’s new president to proclaim investigations of Vice President Joe  Biden’s son Hunter. The elder Biden was at the time the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.

The funds only got released after the obstruction on the aid became known to the public. The blocked funds triggering a congressional probe of that matter, a probe which led to the first impeachment of Trump in the House of Representatives.

The Government Accounting Office (GAO) found that the Trump Office of Management and Budget (OMB) refer to “a policy reason” for withholding $400 million in funds appropriated by Congress to the Defense Department for security assistance to Ukraine.

Legally a policy reason “is not a legitimate or legal motive to withhold funds appropriated by Congress, GAO said and citing the Impoundment Control Act” The GOA went further and stated, “The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.”

The legal and faithful execution of the law does not permit the President or his administration to substitute personal policy priorities for those that Congress has dutifully enacted into law.

The Constitution “specifically vests Congress with the power of the purse.” and Trump, as well as all other presidents, “is not vested with the power to ignore or amend any such duly enacted law.”

The faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law.

Trump was dangling military aid to a country under threat in order to have that country announce unwarranted investigation for the sole purpose of having a negative impact on a political rival.

The lives and security of the Ukrainian people represented nothing to Trump who selfishly pressured a desperate nation to act dishonorably. His only concern in the matter was to get a benefit for him and ignored his duty and ignored the laws under the United States Constitution.",t3_t11uq0,3,politics,t5_2cneq,t11uq0

ere is a long list of Western organizations, governments, and diplomats, as well as Ukrainian anti-corruption groups, that wanted to see Shokin fired.

They include the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, the U.S. government, foreign investors, and Ukrainian advocates of reform.

In a column published days after Shokin was fired in March 2016, Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, wrote that his dismissal came as no surprise.

""The amazing thing is not that he was sacked but that it has taken so long,"" Aslund said. ""Petro Poroshenko appointed Shokin to the role in February 2015. From the outset, he stood out by causing great damage even to Ukraine's substandard legal system.""

""This would all be a small footnote in history except that by 2016, officials throughout the Obama administration and in Western Europe had come to a consensus that Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, wasn’t doing enough to crack down on corruption. Biden, as he later colorfully recounted, delivered the message that the West wanted Shokin gone or else loan guarantees would be held up, and Shokin was, in turn, fired.

There was nothing remotely controversial about this at the time. No congressional Republicans complained about it, and the European Union hailed the decision to fire Shokin. ""

4) Obama/Biden wouldn’t give Ukraine any lethal military items

5) Trump did give large amounts of lethal aid to Ukraine and HAD DONE SO BEFORE THE PHONE CALL;

6) Putin didn’t invade Ukraine during the Trump presidency;

7) Biden effectively green-lighted Putin taking the “separatist regions” with his comments on “minor incursion” not necessarily triggering a response;

8) Putin waited for Biden to be in office (third term of Obama/Biden) and seeing Biden as weak chose to invade not just the “separatist regions” but all of Ukraine.

Would Putin have done this if Trump was still in office?  Impossible to say since we don’t have alternate universes to play this out.

* **Impeached for illegally witholding Ukraine military aid, already appropriated to them by Congress, unless they made up political dirt on Biden. Specifically Ukraine was asking for the Javelin anti-tank systems that are now helping them fend off Russian advancements.**
* Trump dismissed and cast doubt about Russian hacking, particularly when the U.S determined that Russia hacked the DNC in 2016, while ironically enough, he encouraged Russian cyber attacks on national TV saying, ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,""
* When addressing Russian election interference and cyber attacks, Trump proclaimed ""I don't see any reason why it would be Russia"" after speaking directly with Putin, defending Russia and trusting Putin over our own intelligence agencies. Later he ""corrected"" himself, claiming that he meant to say ""wouldn't"" instead of would.
* Trump suggested the U.S. work directly with Russia on cybersecurity. Trump refused to punish or critique the SolarWinds hack.
* Almost directly after the 2016 election, Trump sought to weaken U.S. sanctions on Russia, while he was even open to lifting sanctions.
* Trump dismissed the notion that Putin was a ""killer"", downplaying the idea that Putin resorts to using violence and oppressive tactics to crush political opponents. He defended Putin, rationalizing his ruthless despotism in the process, declaring, ""There are a lot of killers. Do you think our country is so innocent?""
* Trump shared highly classified U.S. intelligence with Russian officials in the Oval Office in 2017.
* Trump repeated Kremlin talking points related to the Russian annexation of Crimea, reiterating things like, ""The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were.""
* Trump constantly attacked NATO, aligning himself with Putin. (quite relevant)
* Trump thanked Putin for expelling hundreds of U.S. diplomats as a retaliation for sanctions.
* Trump refused to make a statement about the 10th anniversary of the Russia-Georgia war. According to John Bolton, European leaders noticed Trump's silence and ""became even more concerned about American resolve.""
* According to congressional testimony, Trump declined to publicly condemn a Russian attack against Ukrainian military vessels in November 2018, even though the State Department prepared a statement for him
* Trump congratulated and gave legitimacy to Putin's re election win in 2018, a victory said to ""lack genuine competition""
* Sergei Skripal, an ex Russian spy that defected to the UK, was poisoned. Sanctions were announced, Trump attempted to rescind them, while asserting that the U.S. was being ""too tough on Putin""
* When congress passed new sanctions against Russia in 2017, Trump was very reluctant to signing the bill, and probably wouldn't have signed it if the bill didn't pass with veto-proof majorities in both houses
* In 2017 it was reported that Trump was considering returning spy bases to Russia.
* Trump praised and highlighted pro-Russian leaders in Europe. Far right European leaders with close ties to Putin. He even met a Kremlin ally at the Whitehouse.
* When Trump withdrew troops from Syria, it gave Russia and Putin an opportunity to control abandoned U.S. outposts and checkpoints.",t1_hydll44,2231,politics,t5_2cneq,t11uq0

My one concern with this is that it may be better explained by Trump's economic agenda rather than his geopolitical agenda. I admit the possibility that it's both, but given his rhetoric with both ""America First"" and his softer words with Putin, I tend to assume those moves were part of an economic agenda. 

Either way, I doubt that either president would have had much impact altogether. During the Trump administration, Putin already started increasing his nuclear armament. That is quite possibly part of a longer-term plan to increase their ability to threaten nuclear war to be able to strong-arm former Soviet countries if he wanted to do exactly what he's doing now. Putin's most recent concern was that Ukraine might join NATO, and the timing of that push is unlikely to have to do with the timing of the American elections. The only direct connection to American elections that seems plausible to me is the possibility that Ukraine thought Biden might be more likely to endorse their bid to join NATO. Otherwise, I highly doubt Trump would have done much more than Biden has done to prevent the invasion. Again, I think that because of the overt America First agenda that Trump shows with both words and actions.

Trump's impeachment came after a formal House inquiry alleged that he had solicited foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election to help his re-election bid, and then obstructed the inquiry itself by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony. ***The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid*** and an invitation to the White House to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in order to influence Ukraine to announce an investigation into Trump's political opponent Joe Biden and to promote a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind interference in the 2016 presidential election. A phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 25, 2019 was particularly important—whistleblower Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was a participant in the call, and later informed Congress.

Where Biden has done a good job is being proactive in declassifying intelligence information and loudly shouting it to the world so that Putin was not able to use that same tactic. Getting rid of that option forced Putin to go in as the invader instead of the liberator. It may seem small but it actually has huge ramifications in the eyes of the general citizens of the NATO countries. In 2014 you didn’t hear this out crying support from citizens around the world like you do now.

Now that’s the best thing he’s done, but he’s also done a great job of mending relationships with Allie’s since he took office. Everyone knows that with Trump, America definitely lost its voice.  He also tried everything to give peace a chance and didn’t give Putin any excuse to try to blame this on the West. No sanctions were put on Russia, even with a 190k troops at the border, but as soon as they went in sanctions started around the world and is already hitting their economy hard. He’s already worked to get Ukraine additional funding as well as now trying to get some more anti missile defense weapons there.

Edit: and to add, while you think this has nothing to do with Trump and everything was fine two years ago, it wasn’t. Putin used Trump to help distance Ukraine from the US in one of the biggest scandals ever.

Hunter Biden had joined the board of Burisma in April 2014, the same month that British officials froze Zlochevsky’s London bank accounts containing $23 million. Britain’s Serious Fraud Office, an independent government agency, was conducting a money-laundering investigation and refused to allow Zlochevsky or Burisma Holdings, the company’s chief legal officer, and another company owned by Zlochevsky access to the accounts.But the British money-laundering investigation was stymied by Ukrainian prosecutors’ refusal to cooperate. The Ukrainian prosecutors would not turn over documents needed in the British investigation, and without that documentary evidence, a British court ordered Britain’s Serious Fraud Office to unfreeze the assets.**In September 2015, then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt gave a speech in which he attacked the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office for failing to cooperate with the British investigation. In his speech — which I quoted in my story — Pyatt mentioned Burisma’s owner by name.**

Why did Shokin actively work against investigating fraud by Burisma again?  Like to explain that one?  Why did Europe and the US want him out including the GOP at the time?

An article summarizing:

A quote:

> During the radio interview, Mr. Trump said he and Mr. Putin had discussed a potential invasion of Ukraine when Mr. Trump was in the White House. “I knew that he always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it,” Mr. Trump said. “I said, ‘You can’t do it. You’re not going to do it.’ But I could see that he wanted it. I used to ask him. We used to talk about it at length.”

I've noticed that questions are often followed by disingenious arguments just as often as they're asked in earnest on social media. There's a large part of the population (not a majority, just a loud minority) without actually caring about the answer. 

[Here's an example that recently happened to me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/sxr3qm/_/hxymi9r) He asked a question, but he already had an opinion he wanted to assert... It didn't matter what my answer was. It's like, if you're not open to new data, then just fucking make your argument, dude.

Overall, I think this crisis is overblown, and that their is presumption being made by a lot of people about how much a problem this is, mostly driving by some sort of repetitive claims of fraud where the evidence is actually not that substantial (and even just fictional).

Everyone still pays their tax in this situation (and in the current situation), but they still have their biases and conflicts of interest which is obviously the root of the problem. 

IMO the only way a law banning trading for them would work is if the government changes significantly at its core, to a point where their culture encourages self-regulation, and shames the lack there of.

Every year, each Congressperson should account for every dollar that came their way, including US tax returns. And when a congressperson leaves office, they need a total disclosure of their wealth.

I bet all the people criticizing her would be even more critical of AOC(who is against congressional insider trading) as speaker of the house. 

As a non-american I'm an outside observer BUT if I was american I would vote single issue on voting reform that does away with every construct that is protecting the current two-party system. Mainly that means instituting a voting system such as scored, ranked or approval voting which are all far better than the current system. Reduced voter regret, reduced strategic voting, and reduced spoiler effect which allows outsider candidates to come in. You can't get rid of parties(people will always group together to form voting/negotiating blocks whether it's official or not), but you can significantly reduce their power on framing the election just by making a system where they can't just dictate the candidates.

The current two party system protects a series of political positions shared by both parties that go strongly against the will of the people(including the one being discussed here). It has to go away. I would place myself strongly to the left but if I was an american I'd vote for a republican if they had a history of working for voting reform(talking the talk isn't enough... politicians lie).

Nothing can change for the better in the long term so long as the current system lies in place. One party tries to make things better, than they swap power, and the other party dismantles that. Over time we've seen expansion of the power of  the president and massive erosion of the checks and balances that were inserted in the system. US democracy(yeah I know it's actually a republic) is extremely flawed in modern days, it needs to be fixed.

tl;dr: on this particular issue both parties are bad, and it's one of the reasons why the US sorely needs voting reform as the duopoly is able to completely ignore the will of the public by agreeing not to touch on certain subjects.",t1_hrkrm2r,2,politics,t5_2cneq,rxqvwi

In 2022 there are enough Republican senators up for re-election to actually make impeachment happen, but not enough in states that will likely flip.

Here's the list:

[Alabama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_elections#Alabama) [Richard Shelby](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Shelby) - Safe Republican. Shelby is retiring, but it won't go D.  

[Alaska](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_elections#Alaska) [Lisa Murkowski](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski) - Safe Republican. Only risk here is her being replaced by someone farther to the right.

[Louisiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_elections#Louisiana) [John Kennedy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kennedy_(Louisiana_politician\)) - Safe Republican. Kennedy isn't just a bad senator, he's DUMB and as fake as a $3 bill. But I don't see LA replacing him.

[Pennsylvania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_elections#Pennsylvania) [Pat Toomey](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Toomey) - Open seat, Toomey retiring. Likely pickup for John Fetterman.

[South Carolina](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_elections#South_Carolina) [Tim Scott](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Scott) - Safe Republican

[Wisconsin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_Senate_elections#Wisconsin) [Ron Johnson](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Johnson_(Wisconsin_politician\)) - Seems possible that fucker Ron Johnson may be indicted for his actions on January 6th, likely pickup for Democrats.

Now, here's the trick, in order for these to be actual pickups, ALL of the Democrats running have to win. Trading seats 1:1 doesn't alter the balance.

So on the D side...

I'm \*totally\* in favor of abortion being a right. ""Pro-life"" is a deal-breaker for my vote. Roe vs Wade was horribly justified from a legal sense in the 1973 decision and as a result it makes perfect sense for the current court to overturn it. Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion even specifically pointed out that the case should have been derived from the 9th amendment rather than the shaky grounds upon which it was argued. It's a miracle that the 1973 court decided as it did back then. 

One should ask AOC and the rest of congress why \*they\* don't do the right thing and pass a constitutional amendment enumerating an individual's body as a right explicitly enumerated under the constitution.

Term limits need to be imposed on Justices and impeachments need to be issued on these three for a blatant misuse of their life long powers to sculpt the definition of a humans rights opposite of what they stated to be a legal ""precedence"" during their confirmation hearings. 

Without honesty in our courts no human rights can be upheld and we will lose the very personal freedoms our nation has fought for with our example of democracy. We can not pick and chose the rights of conscious beings verses inviable cell clusters, because this is taking away the right to life liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for women of this country. 

Us reverting this precedence is a blatant misuse of the powers in our government to play God and will result women being forced to die because they will be FORCED to have a child to term that will kill them.

The truth is its against judicial ethics to say how you would rule in any future case. That's why you never see Congress ask ""Would you uphold Roe v Wade if a case came on the docket that called the precedent into question.""

Instead they have to get at the question in roundabout ways by asking about judicial philosophies and approaches that no one can ever actually hold the nominees to. Nominees for ANY judicial position can answer these questions without tying themselves to deciding any future case a particular way.

Congress knows this. They know that they're asking the question as a analog to the question they're not supposed to ask. The nominees know they can answer the question however they want without being held to it.

If this doesn’t change, if people who’ve been sitting out voting don’t become immediately involved to swing things back, to balance our government, l fear our way of life, our beloved democratic rights, are doomed. Our freedoms are something too many have taken for granted and thought would always be there, but the truth is that our freedoms take constant renewed commitment and involvement to sustain them. We must vote, we must participate, we must take responsibility, we can’t simply leave it up to others to do the work! Register to VOTE and actually do so, in person, by mail, whatever way is best for you, but do it, VOTE! 

Only when we regain majorities in the Federal and State legislatures can we really begin to affect change. We need to rebalance the courts, increase the number of justices to 13 and create enforceable rules they must follow and limit their terms. We need to relook at the Constitution, it is a very important document, but it is also one that was written and ratified by only white men 234 years ago. They did not know in what ways the country and world would evolve and change over time. As good as the Constitution’s ideals and ideas are it is not perfect. As it has always urged us to become a better nation and people, it too can itself be made better. We’ve much work to do and we’re in the 11th hour, time is critical and can no longer be wasted.

309,idv1p34,SharpBeat,"A few thoughts:

1\. Did the justices actually lie? If you look at the actual exchanges at nomination hearings, the words spoken are not as clear cut as AOC and others are painting them to be - frankly her statements feel like misinformation. [Fact Check](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/what-gorsuch-kavanaugh-and-barrett-said-about-roe-at-confirmation-hearings/) has an article on this that goes deeper. Gorsuch declined to call Roe ""super precedent"". Kavanaugh said you have to have an open mind and listen to all arguments if a case needs to be revisited. Barrett said she intends to stick to the rule of law and decide cases as they come. Fact Check said the following to sum it up:

> ""A close examination of the carefully worded answers by the three Trump appointees, however, shows that while each acknowledged at their hearings that Roe was precedent, and should be afforded the weight that that carries, none specifically committed to refusing to consider overturning it.""

2\. Are members of government allowed to change their mind? These rulings are deeply considered in the context of a given case and the arguments within. The actual opinions are hundreds of pages and contain a lot more nuance than one sentence question and answers in a nomination. I think it is important that people have a freedom to change their mind and express their most current opinions.

3\. Regardless of what is stated at a nomination hearing, the job of a judge is to interpret the law as correctly as possible. I would argue that the current justices are correctly doing that, while the ones holding up stare decisis blindly are not doing that. In many cases, precedence is the most expedient choice. But in cases where rulings are more grossly incorrect, that shouldn't be the case. There were doubts about the correctness of Roe's broad ruling for a long time. Even RGB [expressed doubts](https://www.law.uchicago.edu/recordings/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-and-geoffrey-stone-roe-40) and preferred a narrower ruling that only invalidated Texas's abortion law from that time.

4\. Let's leave aside the law and notions like 'under oath' for a second. Other people in the government, like presidents and legislators, make statements and promises all the time that they don't keep. On principle, should they all be impeached?

5\. Abortion simply isn't a constitutional right. There is no provision for it anywhere in the constitution. I prefer that it was, but that means putting in the work to get it that legal support. I also think this is a broader issue than abortion. Why aren't we talking about a bodily autonomy constitutional amendment, given that control over one's own body is a very fundamental level of individual freedom? That seems like it could get support from both sides of the aisle, especially with the recent context of vaccine mandates. It seems like the political left is currently seeking shortcuts like protesting, rioting, impeachment, sanctuary states, undermining the legitimacy of institutions like SCOTUS, calling to ignore the SCOTUS ruling, and so on - anything but actually doing the work of persuading constituents, following the actual political process, passing laws, proposing amendments, and sticking to norms. That is not going to work out well in the long term, and undermining this ruling may even ultimately threaten national political stability.",t3_vl6xm2,2,politics,t5_2cneq,vl6xm2
310,idv33ag,datfroggo765,"Yep, I agree. They lied under oath. Idgaf what excuse they use. ""OH my mind changed"" , ""oh I learned new information"", ""oh I realized i was wrong during my hearing"". Go fuck yourself. You said it was decided and were not interested in pursuing it due to precedent. You wouldn't have gotten approved if you didn't lie. You shouldn't have been confirmed. We need a way to call for an impeachment and vote as a country instead of requiring congress to act.

It is worth noting, btw, that the legal right to murder the unborn prior to the 15 week mark still stands. The US was an outlier (one of 12 nations out of 198) with the expansive Roe v. Wade ruling allowing abortion up until the very end. Functionally, nothing really changes here other than it puts the US in line with other radically right wing countries such as France, Germany, Belgium, etc. You know, those fascist right wing religious whack jobs. 

This is a tempest in a teacup. If that.

513,idtv54v,declawedboys,"I agree, they most certainly lied.

That being said, I hate the logic here. Why? So let's imagine a different scenario: gay marriage. Imagine a judge was asked, under oath, a few years ago to state if they believed that marriage was between a man and a woman and they said, under oath, they only believe in marriage between a man and a woman. Fast forward to the present and the same judge makes a decision to uphold same-sex marriage. In the time between when they were questioned under oath and the present, their mind has changed on the issue. Should they be impeached? 

A call to impeach would lock people into stances, it would mean that persuasion would be off the table if a judge had ever said anything under oath on an issue. It would mean they would need to block themselves off from new facts.

Yes, I absolutely believe these judges lied under oath in regards to abortion. But I can't prove it. Maybe I can prove that they personally disapprove of abortion, but I know plenty who do who also believe in safe, legal access to abortions. So I can't prove their dishonesty by necessarily looking at their personal stance on the issue. And I can't look at this ruling as proof they lied because they can claim that the legal arguments used persuaded them to change their mind, and we want judges who can persuaded by well-crafted, well-reasoned arguments. 

So do you impeach any judge who doesn't have a perfectly consistent track record? No. Clearly not. 

There's two justices that can be credibly investigated for crimes (sexual assault, if the allegations are true both did perjure themselves and it's could be proven), one of which who probably should be impeached for failing to recuse himself in a matter pertaining to his wife's role in a coup attempt. The other accused sexual abuser had large debts paid off by an undisclosed entity, a clear reason to be concerned on ethical grounds and could be reason to impeach if it violates codes of ethics that lawyers and judges are expected to abide by.

If we can successfully impeach a one-term insurrectionist moron of a president twice and STILL not get him removed from office, what makes anyone think we can remove three Supreme Court justices by MAYBE proving that they lied? Democrats can barely muster a vote without Republican support on easy bills. And we think impeachment is going to be any different? Absolutely not.

This is a coup from another angle, and all of the bloviating about voting more, or impeaching, or whatever will do little to assuage the very real reality that conservatives and republicans have infiltrated the core circles of American government to a point of no return.

As far as I’m concerned, there is no civil solution to this dilemma. Dems haven’t done it in the past, they can’t do it now, and they won’t do it in the future, and no amount of handholding and singing on the steps of whatever government building they choose will do shit to fix it.

I just want to remind everyone that Ginni has been actively corrupting SCOTUS and our entire legal system. There have been many claims that Clarence can still be impartial, including among conservatives. This is bullshit, because Ginni is directly involved in matters relating to the Supreme Court. Republicans will also say ""Well that's not true.""

Well then [why did Ginni feel the need to apologize to the SCOTUS clerks?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/ginni-thomas-apology-clarence-thomas-clerks-trump-rally/2021/02/02/a9818cce-6496-11eb-8c64-9595888caa15_story.html)

> Conservative political activist Virginia Thomas told her husband Justice Clarence Thomas’s former law clerks that she was sorry for a rift that developed among them **after her election advocacy of President Donald Trump and endorsement of the Jan. 6 rally in D.C.** that resulted in violence and death at the Capitol.
> 
> “I owe you all an apology. **I have likely imposed on you my lifetime passions,**” Thomas, who goes by Ginni, recently wrote to a private Thomas Clerk World email list of her husband’s staff over his three decades on the bench.
> 
> “My passions and beliefs are likely shared with the bulk of you, but certainly not all. And sometimes the smallest matters can divide loved ones for too long. Let’s pledge to not let politics divide THIS family, and learn to speak more gently and knowingly across the divide.”

She actively admitted that she's imposing her personal beliefs on SCOTUS clerks and has been for *several decades*. And she's been doing this from a position which she was neither elected nor appointed, and she's been doing it covertly. Now she is trying to cover it all up and pretend it's not incredibly wrong by playing ""let's all just be friends/we're a family"" card after an *attempted coup which she actively supported and espoused*.

***BUT WAIT! THERE IS MORE:***

Also, for those not already aware, Supreme Court clerkships are almost *always* a fast-track to becoming a Judge, and is simply a matter of major prestige for lawyers in general. Of all the Federal Judges out there, especially Circuit Courts, a significant number of them had a clerkship at SCOTUS.

Turns out, [Clarence's clerks have been funneled upwards more than *any other judge's*.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/clarence-thomas-trump/593596/) And it was done during Trump's administration.

> Numbers are the first evidence of the sizable Thomas effect. He has had more of his former clerks nominated to federal judgeships under Trump than any other justice, past or present: 10, compared with Anthony Kennedy’s seven and Scalia’s five. Roughly one-fifth of Thomas’s former clerks either are in the Trump administration or have been nominated to the federal bench by the president. The clerks whom Thomas trained, has mentored, and actively stays in touch with are taking up lifetime appointments, and on the whole, they are quite young: Allison Jones Rushing, who now sits on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, is just in her mid-30s.

It's abundantly clear that Clarence and Ginni Thomas have been directly influencing our entire legal system without **any** recourse or redress from the American public, and they've been doing it with the specific intent of corrupting it to the advantage of one political party and their agenda.

And as if that's not enough, they have been doing it covertly, and Ginni, when caught with her hand in the cookie jar, is trying to paint herself as totally innocent while Republicans and Clarence have been pretending that there's nothing wrong with it and that Clarence can still be objective.",t1_idtjho0,2519,politics,t5_2cneq,vl6xm2

- Restrictions of use of crowd control weapons. Any use of crown control weapons must be authorised by the chief of police.

- a duty to intervene. Any officer must intervene if they witness another officer use prohibited, inappropriate, or unreasonable force. Intervention must be attempted both verbally and physically.

- a duty to report. Any officer witnessing another officer use prohibited, inappropriate, or unreasonable force must report it immediately, while still on scene, to their commander or their commanders superior. They must also notify internal affairs.

- complete ban on all neck restraints. Pretty self-explanatory.

- body cam compliance. Officers must complete their initial reports before viewing their body cam footage

- union involvement. Officers involved in critical incidents are prohibited from speaking with any union officials while at the crime scene.

- use of deadly force. Officers must consider all other reasonable alternatives to deadly force before employing it officers must attempt de-escalation techniques as a first resort whenever feasible.

- use of de-escalation techniques. Officers reports must include documentation of which de-escalation attempts were made prior to the use of force. This has later been expanded to clarify that unholstering a firearm is considered use of force which must be preceded by de-escalation attempts.

- officers actions leading to use of force. Officers are expressly prohibited from escalating a situation through words or actions. If this happens regardless the escalated situation cannot be used to justify a use of force.

- shooting at vehicles. Officers are prohibited from firing at a moving vehicle under any circumstances except when the officer or another person is threatened with deadly force and firing on the vehicle can feasibly prevent that threat.

- restrictions on unannounced warrants. Almost complete ban on no-knock entries, with hostage situations being the one circumstance where it can be allowed.
