It is a common practice to give honorary black belts, with the degree varying, depending on the giving organisation and the person it is awarded to (see Zlatan Ibrahimovic). The common practice is, if the awarding organization is a local federation, to award a 4th or 5th degree Black Belt. The 9th Dan was probably given to him by the World federation (in this case the International Taekwondo Federation, since they are different things).

> &quot;World Taekwondo strongly condemns the brutal attacks on innocent lives in Ukraine, which go against the World Taekwondo vision of &#039;Peace is More Precious than Triumph&#039; and the World Taekwondo values of respect and tolerance. [W]orld Taekwondo&#039;s thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and we hope for a peaceful and immediate end to this war,&quot; the organization said in a statement.

> In light of the ongoing war conflict in Ukraine, the International Judo Federation announces the suspension of Mr. Vladimir Putin&#039;s status as Honorary President and Ambassador of the International Judo Federation.

They're awarded and recognized as a symbol of respect. To the people who hold such titles, it has profound meaning.

Now, to Putin? It probably doesn't have as much significance.

But the leaders of this organization know that he holds a symbol and title worthy of respect within their circles.

And they probably think, given current events, that his title and accreditation is no longer deserved.

They can't freeze his assets. They can't hurt him in any appreciable way. They can't really do MUCH. But what they CAN do is stop looking at his black belt and feeling shamful about it.

Not for any effect it might have on HIM. But for the edification of their own moral agency.

To paraphrase: ""We no longer respect you. Though you have the skills necessary to be destructive, you lack another quality necessary to warrant this.""

What necessary quality does this organization think Putin lacks? Doesn't that seem like an accurate metaphore for what's happening in Ukraine?

Effectively meaningless. And perhaps you might say it's pointless. And to you, it might be. But to THEM, it was the only moral thing they COULD do. It would not have been moral to allow Putin to RETAIN such standing.

No, you don't get pornhub because we don't believe belligerent state actors deserve the pleasure.

At the end of his life Putin will be humiliated and this probably will the end of his grip over Russia.

And last but not least, there are the old-school martial arts like Jiu-Jitsu or Bujinkan, which are foremost fighting arts derived from what you needed at war in former times.

However, nowadays with the invention of the gun, martial arts are more about friendly competition.

Parliamentary business will be suspended immediately for at least six parliamentary days, in order to allow authorities to  prepare for the funeral.

The parliament will then prepare a motion of condolence within 72 hours of reconvening. The Queen's coffin will first lie in repose at Holyrood Palace, followed by a service of reception at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. Following this, the coffin would then be transported to Waverley station and then taken by the Royal Train to London if possible.

Otherwise, the coffin would be taken by plane to London and welcomed by the prime minister and cabinet ministers.

The longest reigning monarch, King Louis XIV of France, became king at age 4 and was king until a his death at age 76. Elizabeth was 20 years older when she died.

To me, her passing away is less about the death of a person or even a monarch. It's more about the end and passing away of an era and symbol. 

As long as I've been alive, the queen's always been there. It's like that feeling you get when the story of a character you grew up reading about finally ends. 

I'm left with nothing but reminiscent emotions, a sense of loss and a little bit of happiness that she lived a good life until the end. 

Remaining active and passing away peacefully at such an age, despite sad, still seems beautiful. Not many people at her age can have such peaceful ends and that's something I can find satisfaction in.

Like many British people, I don’t care for the monarchy - it is Elizabeth the people love. Even the staunchest republican cannot deny that a remarkable bond existed between Elizabeth and the people. 

We all knew it was bad when the 7 houses were called.

Even if they’re a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig. When I heard of the Queen's death, I was flabbergasted. But the real lesson for me about going to Peppa Pig World – I’m surprised you haven’t been there – was about the power of UK creativity. Who would have believed, Tony, that a pig that looks like a hairdryer or possibly, well a sort-of Picasso-like hairdryer, a pig that was rejected by the BBC would now be exported to 180 countries, with theme parks both in China and the US, as well as in the New Forest. Now, I think that it is pure genius, don’t you? Peppa Pig? So my final message to you, as we mourn the death of the Queen, we are blessed, we are blessed with the right time zone and the right language and opportunity across the whole country, we are blessed with our amazing inventive power and Peppa Pig.

Two days ago, I read that within Russia, US intelligence reports were being dismissed by the public as part of an American misinformation campaign. But now that it's playing out \*exactly as the US said it would,\* it seriously undermines Putin's frequent talking point that the US is lying. 

I don't say any of this to chest-thump for the US, but to show how badly I think Putin has miscalculated. The approach the US took these past several weeks in publicly and frequently airing accurate intelligence has put Putin in a tough spot. There's no getting around the fact that he's been lying this whole time (to the world and to his own people), and that the US was telling the truth. 

There's a universe where Putin could have NOT invaded Ukraine and actually made Biden look like an alarmist fool. But he didn't do that, and now he's the one who is coming across as irrational. No idea if this will lead to Putin's overthrow (wishful thinking) but hopefully it dulls his sheen within Russia and helps more Russians understand that he's not trustworthy.",t3_t0b6fb,64,worldnews,t5_2qh13,t0b6fb

My take on NATO’s strategy here. Putin’s expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin’s logical madness. 

NATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin’s obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. 

When toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. 

The issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin’s ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe’s economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO’s hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. 

As Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to “contested” regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. 

With Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin’s circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. 

The west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn’t know, and isn’t deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.

dit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are. I’m just calling it like I see it.

Mr. Posey,


I am a traditionally independent voter and am pleased to say I voted for you in the previous election and look forward to your next election to continue this tradition.  


In the past few years, many issues have become extraordinarily partisan.  For example, pandemic safety measures and/or supporting your police has become partisan where you have to choose a side it seems.  I am writing to ask that you do your part not to allow the war in Ukraine and support of Vladimir Putin of Russia to become a partisan issue and for you to support condemning this clear attack on democracy in Ukraine.  It is easy for us to find a spin that allows us to rationalize whatever nuttiness our political allies, friends and representatives say or do because they are on ""our team"", but in this case, we should all be on the same team.


During 9/11, the Ukrainian parliament passed three resolutions all in favor of assisting the United States following the attacks.  They stood buy us during possibly our darkest hour in recent history and I ask that you remember that when any votes or concerns are put before you.


Please remember that time and pride you felt during 9/11 when the world offered its support to us and we all liked each other and repay that as much as we can to support our fellows in democracy suffering in the Ukraine.

1. How many people attend the protests, how consistently they're willing to show up to the protests, and how many people are unable to attend the protests but silently support them

2. How powerful the Russian officials who oppose Putin's invasion are, whether they have secure control over lots of wealth or leadership positions within the military/intelligence agencies/law enforcement

MINE EDIT: heres part of what is in the link. Advise you to read the full page tho:

If you entered Poland based on:

visa-free travel regime – your legal stay is 90 days;

national visa or a Schengen visa – your stay is legal in accordance with the period of validity of the visa and the residency period indicated therein; After the expiry of the residence on the basis of the national visa, you can continue your stay without leaving under visa-free movement up to 90 days with a biometric passport;

long-term visa or a residence permit issued by another Schengen state - your legal stay is going to last up to 90 days;

consent of the commander in Chief of the Polish Border Guard – your legal stay lasts 15 days.

If you wish to extend your legal stay, you can file an application for granting temporary residence permit, or in the case of meeting the criteria on granting permanent residence permit. These applications shall be submitted in the Voivodeship Office having jurisdiction over the place of residence.

Regardless of the above, you will be permitted to legally stay in the territory of the Republic of Poland on the basis of special provisions regarding the COVID-19 epidemic.

Follow this website – we are going to update it and provide the key information.

If you need additional information, please call the following infoline: +48 47 721 75 75 

Tl;dr: polish borders are open. You can get there without visas just passport is enough. Without visa you can only stay 90 days though.

Edit: just now in polish news it was said that the wait time to cross polish border in the city ""Medyka"" is 8 hours. I can only assume that its similiar everywhere else.

I'm Russian and here's my thoughts:
- No one expected that
- I don't know anyone from my friends or colleagues who support this, today is a day of mourning, we can't believe it's happening
- Sadly, there are people who support it, but mainly from uneducated layers of society, who were zombies by TV (Putin spends lots of our money on internal propaganda)
- We are fighting Putin since 2012, but he surrounded himself with loyal, heartless, cynical, unscrupulous people, and created his own army (national guard). Ppolice, NatGuard and army are loyal to him, because that's mainly people without any prospects, and this service gives them lots of power and impunity, they can mostly anything without consequences

- People, who participate in rallys are often being beaten and go to jail. People who organise peaceful demonstration are claimed as terrorists and go to jail after fast unlawful court. You can go to jail even for blog post.
- When a couple of days ago Western countries announced sanctions against Putin and his entourage, everyone were saying ""Wow, are they on our side? Why they waited so long?""
- It's really sad to see comments like ""Russians are nazys"", ""I hate russians"", ""Fuck Russia"".

    No, we are not, no are not supporting this, we suffer as well and will suffer a lot more now, living in poverty with the whole world against us.

892,hymby70,Dystopic_Panda,"There are a bunch of different outcomes. The cause of the war is Russia's desire to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and the European Union. The current Ukrainian government has been extremely hostile to Russian interests and very keen to push forward negotiations to join both of those organizations. From a Russian geopolitical perspective, this is unacceptable. The russian ruling class feels backed into a corner. If they allow Ukraine to join NATO, that means American and Western European powers will have military bases and military staging areas along the border and extremely close to the Russian heartland, and once Ukraine is part of NATO and begins receiving military infrastructure development, there's no putting the cat back into the bag. It's there to stay. So a short-term war to avoid extreme long-term military disadvantages seems beneficial to Russian security interests.

If Mexico attempted to join into a military alliance with Russia that allowed Russia to build extremely advanced military installations and missile attack/defense systems along the border, the US would do everything it possibly could to keep that from happening. I think the Russian elite feel helpless, in that their hand is forced to make this gamble, otherwise Russia will be hemmed in and at the mercy of the American military if a total war were to happen.

Putin's endgame is a regime change in Ukraine to someone who will not try to join NATO, or if that doesn't, at the very least, to show that Russia does have the will and ability to attack Ukraine, so allowing Ukraine to join would be extremely risky as it would obligate the USA to come to Ukraine's defense if there were a future war.

It's not to say that humour doesn't have a place, but it's always over saturated with the most generic rank-and-file jokes that will have the broadest impact and likelihood of being upvoted. It's always the same tired jokes, unoriginal, uncreative and all around annoying. Usually these jokes are followed by endless streams of people trying to piggyback off the first unoriginal with their uncreative flair added to it. 

Much of Reddit has become Redditors regurgitating comments whether it be insights, jokes, ideas, and or opinions — not a single original thought. It's funny when you can tell Reddit has learned a new word or saying that gets repeated regularly, zero-sum game, Occam's razor, or when you can see the gradual shift of opinion that you know is almost exclusively based on other Reddit comments that are based on other comments that are ultimately based on an opinion that was born from reading the clickbait headline without any further nuance.

Those anti tank munitions that were plug and play were on their way to some other close country just in case fighting spilled over to their country and the aircraft took small arms fire and had to drop it's load to lose weight since they hit a fuel tank and they wouldn't have made it back.

We don't know where the munitions dropped, somewhere between here and there but by now someone got ahold of them.

I mean whoever that ""someone"" is that had to ""mistakenly"" drop the weapons due to reported small arms damage to the aircraft they were in. I've heard worse stories from big governments on other ""mistakes"" so this seems easy to pull off in the political bullshit forum for these guys.

Hopefully it doesn't happens again but who knows.. someone might leak flight plans and manifests for cargo and target those planes and they keep unfortunately getting shot and losing cargo around ukraining held areas so that cargo **whoops** is in Ukrainian military hands and **whoops** it's just what they needed but we promise it was planned to be delivered somewhere else but the trigger happy Russian armed forces on the ground keep shooting at our humanitarian aid aircraft so those supplies and stuff bound for someone else **whoops** got shot up and dropped in Ukrainian held points in country.

Bigger bullshit stories have floated before. Easy way for ""someone"" to help them without knowledge.

This could spell the end of Putin. Those with ties to the Kremlin or Russian Citizens are now no longer afraid to voice their disgust at the Invasion, by protests and speaking out in media interviews.

Russia may be cut off from SWIFT bank system by Monday, and they are already behind where Putin expected them to be by now, and thinks it is only two weeks to completely overthrow Ukraine.

Ukraine hold strong because once SWIFT ban takes place it will hit every single russian citizen (as well as the west, oil etc. Is paid through swift), I expect more protests, more discontent within the Kremlin, a Ukrainian army getting stronger as they hold each day, and a world that see Russia as a pariah state, ultimately leading to Putin being overthrown from inside.",t3_t1o8wq,3,worldnews,t5_2qh13,t1o8wq

Not saying other leaders are bad, I don't know each and every single one on this planet, but I do see that this guy is a human being like his people and not a robot, not someone lead by his lobby, he is leading! And it seems to me, his interest, and also Klitschkos (who is worth a couple millions, he could be anywhere he wants in this world) - became politics to truly help their country and they do care about the people. They do not flee, they are VERY ready to fight!   
... This is the actual JOB, he is doing his job the way everyone should be.   
I hope one day on this planet earth, there will come a time, where the ones who aren't greedy and careless, narcissistic and disgusting will be the leaders of this world.  
I have seen an actual switch in society.... back when I was a teenager, I mean, thats 20 years ago, so not THAT long, yet people have changed and I feel like people do care more about each other, of course the internet and the general globalization is what made this happen. But it also made the mighty and powerful even more ... of what they already are. Extremely powerful  
As long as the dictatorian countries keep stacking up their military and all they have in mind is POWER; ... this won't be a place for HUMAN BEINGS to live (a good life). Most of us 7 billion folks on this planet want to live free, happy and without war. The fact that nukes came into play makes us every day Joes helpless and angry. It's unfortunate that the world isn't a peaceful place when everything we have, nature, animals, love, speech, families, all the beautiful things isn't enough.  
So the every day Joe at some point became greedy, this could be you and me. Every one who smelled security and wealth doesn't want to give up on it, meh, maybe some, maybe some people who want to chill on an island because they've had enough and can see through the fake bs we're stuck in.   
Every wealthy person is wealthy because 100000 other people or even 100000's are poor, very poor!   
And when I say wealth, I am speaking about having a place to live and clean water. This is where it starts at least......... clean water and food.

He's going outside to also help dispel fake news about him. Fake claims he has fled and abandoned Ukraine, or told the military to surrender (which isn't true).

An example of how powerful social media is, was shown when the Taliban took over Afghanistan. They would record themselves accepting surrenders. When it was peaceful, they would share that on social media. They would also stage surrenders to be shared as well. Having seen such videos, it helped to encourage more places to surrender. Speeding up their take over.
